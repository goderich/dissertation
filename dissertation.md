## Phoneme inventories and phonotactics

<!-- TODO: add/rewrite. stress here? -->

The consonant inventories of the various Atayal dialects are mostly very similar to each other. The major differences are in the presence of absence of /q/ and /c/ phonemes, which in some dialects merge with /ʔ/ and /s/, respectively.

In the following sections, I will describe the consonant inventories of seven Atayal dialects separately, providing specifics of articulation where appropriate.

### Squliq

#### Squliq consonant inventory

Squliq is the biggest Atayal dialect in terms of the number of speakers and the geographical area over which it is spoken. There is inevitably a certain amount of phonetic variation in Squliq spoken in various geographically separate locations. Nevertheless, the differences between varieties of Squliq do not extend to the consonant inventory. @tbl:squliq-consonants presents the consonant phonemes of Squliq.
<!-- TODO: there are dialects in I-lan which are likely Squliq but merged q into ʔ (see li1998). I should talk about them somewhere. -->

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Squliq Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:squliq-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p     & t        & k      & q     & ' [ʔ] \\

w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Squliq preserves /q/ and /ʔ/ as separate phonemes. The voiced labial obstruent /b/ is most often realized as a voiced labiodental fricative [v], but can also be a voiced bilabial fricative [β] in the speech of older and more conservative speakers.

The phoneme /c/ is not found in the dialect as a distinct root-internal phoneme, but coronal affricates can still appear in the dialect in several situations: (1) as an allophone of /t/ before the high front vowel /i/ or the palatal approximant /y/, (2) as an allophone of /t/ in word-final position, and (3) in the derivational prefix *c-* [@egerod1966, p. 123;@li1980, pp. 362-363].

In the first case, it is fully in complementary distribution with the plosive [t], and can be analyzed as an allophone of the phoneme /t/ directly preceding the vowel /i/ or the glide /y/. Note that while orthographically it is still written as \<c\>, phonetically it is an alveolo-palatal affricate [tɕ].

Word-final /t/ may also be affricatized as [ts] in the speech of some Squliq speakers, and this is sometimes reflected in writing [@huang2016a, p. 12]. This is a purely phonetic feature and has no bearing on the phonological system of the dialect.

The derivational prefix *c-* is what makes /c/ a phoneme. This prefix forms causative and reciprocal verbs, among other functions [@rau1992, pp. 102-104;@hayung2008, sec. 2.8]: e.g. *c-* + *baq* 'to know' > *cbaq* 'to teach', *c-* + *beng* 'to grasp' > *cbeng* 'to grasp each other'. Phonetically speaking, it is followed by a schwa vowel, so *cbaq* 'to teach' is pronounced [tsə.ˈvaq]. The prefix *c-* contrasts with another derivational prefix *t-* [@hayung2008], so they cannot be analyzed as allophones here.

The status of /z/, phonetically a voiced alveolo-palatal fricative [ʑ], was addressed by @huang2015a, who examined its distribution relative to /y/ in several varieties of Squliq. Huang's conclusion was that the two sounds are in complementary distribution in some varieties of Squliq, but minimally contrastive in others [@huang2015a, p. 254]. Even in varieties that show a distinction between /z/ and /y/, there are no minimal pairs, and the phonemic status of /z/ remains marginal.

#### Squliq vowel inventory {#sec:squliq-vowels}

The vowel system of Squliq Atayal has traditionally been analyzed as /a i u e o/ [@egerod1966;@li1980;@huang2006a;@huang2016a]. The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ are much rarer than the vowels /i u a/, and they correspond to VG sequences /ay/ and /aw/ in some varieties of Squliq and other Atayal dialects [@li1980, pp. 354-355]. The high vowels /i/ and /u/ are centralized when adjacent to post-dorsal consonants /q/ and /h/, and may be perceived and written as mid vowels instead. <!-- TODO cite -->

On the other hand, almost no studies treat [ə] as a phoneme, and it is instead considered a purely phonetic vowel that breaks up underlying consonant clusters [@li1980, p. 355]. @yamada1974 do analyze it as a phoneme, but also note that its distribution is constrained to unstressed (non-final) syllables. @cheng2001 presents data that constitutes near-minimal pairs of CG and CəG sequences, e.g. *hwa.hun* 'to destroy (PV)' vs *hə.wa.kun* 'to support by the arm (PV)'. @huang2014 treats these distinctions as stemming from glides being in the nucleus or the onset, but here I shall instead treat schwa as a marginal phoneme based on Cheng's examples.
<!-- TODO: create citation for cheng2001 from huang 2014 -->

The vowel inventory of Squliq Atayal as analyzed here is presented in @tbl:squliq-vowels. The vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ are fully phonemic, while the central vowel /ə/ has a more limited distribution, and is treated as a marginal phoneme.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Squliq Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:squliq-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
e     & (ə)    & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This analysis is different from the commonly used analyses of the Squliq vowel system. The main difference is in the inclusion of /ə/, albeit as a quasi-phoneme due to its limited distribution: it is not able to receive stress and is the 'default' vowel that other vowels are lenited to. The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ can be analyzed as phonemic in some varieties of Squliq, but are absent from others [@li1980, pp. 354-355]. The varieties that do not have /e/ and /o/ phonemes will instead have VG or GV sequences in corresponding positions.

#### Squliq phonotactics

Squliq disallows true consonant clusters [@huang2006a]. Any apparent tautosyllabic consonant clusters have an intervening schwa vowel that is unwritten in the orthography of the language. Tautosyllabic CG sequences can be found, but are not consonant clusters: the glide in these sequences phonologically behaves like a vowel, and is therefore analyzed as part of the nucleus [@huang2006a, sec. 5].

The syllable types of Squliq Atayal are presented in @tbl:squliq-syllable-types. The table includes only those syllable types which are found across different varieties of Squliq. Some varieties allow more complex syllable structure, as discussed below.

: Syllable types in Squliq Atayal {#tbl:squliq-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss             |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| CV            | qu.tux  | 'one'             |
| CGV           | qwa.lax | 'rain'            |
| CVC           | baq     | 'to know'         |
| CGVC          | qwaw    | 'alcoholic drink' |

<!-- TODO: add syllable types that occur in part of Squliq variants -->
When open syllables occur word-finally, the vowel is lengthened, for example *bisuw* [vi.ˈsuː] 'worm'. These syllables can alternatively be analyzed as CVG with a homorganic glide coda [@huang2006a, p. 61]. The vowels in these syllables are limited to /i/ and /u/, and the syllables can only occur in word-final position. The vowel length in these syllables comes from an original consonantal coda, which lenited and is no longer found in Squliq [@li1981, sec. 2.8]. The same syllable type can be seen in all dialects of Atayal, with the same or similar origin.
<!-- TODO: add link to reconstruction chapter -->

There are variations in the phonotactics of Squliq in different regions. Huang [-@huang2006a, p. 66] notes that Taoshan Squliq allows root-internal codas and word-final CVGC syllables, but Jianshi Squliq does not. @tbl:squliq-syllable-types includes only syllable types found in all varieties of Squliq.

Some Squliq consonants have a limited distribution. The phoneme /x/ cannot occur word-initially [@li1981, p. 239]. The phonemes /b/ and /g/ cannot occur word-finally, and neither can the quasi-phoneme /z/ [@li1981, p. 240]. @li1981 also claimed that /r/ was disallowed in word-final position in Squliq, but Huang [-@huang2006a, p. 64] listed several counterexamples with word-final /r/ in Taoshan Squliq. Even though /r/ can appear word-finally, it is extremely rare in this position, and is replaced with /l/ by some speakers.

The voiceless dental plosive /t/ is affricatized before a high front vowel /i/ or the corresponding glide /y/, as seen in @tbl:squliq-t-affrication.

: Affrication of /t/ in Squliq {#tbl:squliq-t-affrication}

| Word   | Transcription | Gloss   |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| cimuʔ  | [tɕi.ˈmuʔ]    | 'salt'  |
| cyugal | [tɕu.ˈgal]    | 'three' |

This behaviour can be analyzed as an allophone of the phoneme /t/, or as the phoneme /c/ occurring in complementary distribution with /t/ in this environment. Diachronically speaking, /t/ is in the middle of a split, so both interpretations are possible at this time.

The phoneme /k/ followed by /q/ or /h/ in the same word in other dialects, in Squliq corresponds to /q/ instead. In other words, Squliq tends to avoid /k..q/ or /k..h/ sequences in the same word, though they are not disallowed entirely. See examples in @tbl:dorsal-harmony-squliq [from @li1980, p. 377].

: Dorsal harmony in Squliq {#tbl:dorsal-harmony-squliq}

| Squliq  | S'uli'  | Matu'uwal | Gloss        |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| qəhuniq | kahuniʔ | kahuniq   | 'tree'       |
| qətəhuy | katahuy | kithuw    | 'fat, thick' |

Both words in Squliq have an initial /q/ phoneme, but begin with a /k/ in both S'uli' and Matu'uwal. The final phoneme in 'tree' is /q/ in Squliq and Matu'uwal, and /ʔ/ in S'uli', which is the regular correspondence. Squliq underwent a process called *dorsal consonant harmony*, whereby a historical *k was backed into /q/ in some environments. This process also occurred in Skikun [@li1980, p. 377] and Seediq [@lee2009].
<!-- TODO: add link to regular correspondences and dorsal harmony -->

Some Squliq speakers do not allow /l/ to occur in word-final position, and replace it with /n/ [@rau2000]. This is a sound change in progress; it has not yet completed for all Squliq speakers. This merger can also be found in other Atayal dialects, see @sec:merger-final-l-n.

Squliq, like several other Atayal dialects, has a vowel weakening rule under which all vowel distinctions outside the rightmost foot are lost [@egerod1965, p. 255-257;@li1980, pp. 369-370]. This weakening rule is demonstrated in @sec:prepen-vowel-weakening. Put another way, this rule means that no vowels other than schwa can occur anywhere except the final two syllables. One exception in native Atayal vocabulary is the perfective infix *-in-* in some varieties of Squliq, where it retains its vowel regardless of its position within a word. Another exception is the interjection *talagay* 'wow!', which has a cardinal vowel in the third-to-last syllable.

### Matu'uwal

#### Matu'uwal consonant inventory

Matu'uwal Atayal, spoken in three villages in Tai'an township, Miaoli county, has been described by researchers as 'conservative' [@li1981, p. 236;@huang2000, p. 364]. While this descriptor is overly broad, it is true for some aspects of its phonology, including its consonant inventory, shown in @tbl:matuuwal-consonants.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'uwal Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:matuuwal-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p     & t        & k      & q     & ' [ʔ] \\
b [β] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & c [ts]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ng [ŋ] &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Matu'uwal preserves historical /q/ and /c/ as separate phonemes, and is one of only two Atayal dialects to do so (the other being Skikun). Older speakers of Matu'uwal use the voiced bilabial fricative [β] pronunciation of the phoneme /b/. Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that allows the phonemes /b/ and /g/ to occur word-finally, see @sec:matuuwal-phonotactics for more details.

Matu'uwal spoken in Qing'an village (清安村) lacks the phoneme /c/, and it completely merged with /s/. My data comes from speakers in Jinshuei village (錦水村), whose dialect preserves the contrast between /c/ and /s/.

#### Matu'uwal vowel inventory

The vowel inventory of Matu'uwal is simpler than that of other dialects. @tbl:matuuwal-vowels presents the vowels of Matu'uwal.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'uwal Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:matuuwal-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
      & (ə)    &       \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Unlike most other Atayal dialects, Matu'uwal does not have any occurrences of mid vowels [e] and [o] in native vocabulary (though they may occur in Japanese or Sinitic loanwords). Instead, Matu'uwal will have VG sequences /ay/ and /aw/ or hiatuses /ai/ and /au/ where other dialects have mid vowels. @sec:matuuwal-phonotactics goes into more detail on Matu'uwal hiatuses.

Like Squliq, Matu'uwal allows the mid central vowel to occur in the surface representation, but it is quite rare. Matu'uwal does not reduce all prepenultimate vowels, and preserves vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, although it does have vowel reductions of a different kind, see @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng. Its appearance is restricted the initial open syllables, e.g. *bəhut* 'squirrel'.

#### Matu'uwal phonotactics {#sec:matuuwal-phonotactics}

Matu'uwal syllables are maximally CVC [@huang2015, pp. 58-59]. The full range of syllable types is rather small, and presented in @tbl:matuuwal-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in Matu'uwal Atayal {#tbl:matuuwal-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| CV            | qu.tux  | 'one'     |
| VC            | ra.an   | 'road'    |
| CVC           | baq     | 'to know' |

Just like in other Atayal dialects, the vowel in final open syllables is lengthened. Unlike other Atayal dialects, this vowel can be /a/, e.g. *taka* [ta.ˈkaː] 'frog, toad'. This makes it impossible to analyze final open syllables as having an underlying homorganic glide coda, since [a] does not have a corresponding glide [@huang2015, p. 61]. Open syllables in Matu'uwal are mostly due to the deletion of word-final Proto-Atayal \*ɹ. <!-- TODO: link corresponding chapter -->

Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that allows onsetless syllables, but these can only occur in word-final position. Similar to final open syllables, Matu'uwal **hiatuses**, or vowel clusters, are the result of the loss of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ. Hiatuses can be either two identical vowels (/a.a/, /i.i/, /u.u/), or a vowel sequence with decreasing sonority (/a.i/, /a.u/). Phonetically, these hiatuses are distinct from VG sequences: there are two audible syllable peaks; and stress, which is always word-final in all Atayal dialects, falls on the second vowel. The reason for this analysis is the difference in phonological behaviour between these two sets, see @sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution for a detailed explanation.
<!-- [Stress in Atayal is realized as a pitch drop, and stressed syllables also have a higher intensity. Penultimate syllables tend to have a rising pitch in anticipation of the final pitch drop.] -->
<!-- TODO: should i move the discussion of stress somewhere else? -->

Some studies describe CGVC or CVGC syllables in Matu'uwal [@lu2005], but here I agree with Huang [-@huang2015, p. 59] in analyzing them as disyllabic sequences CV.GVC or CV.VC.

Matu'uwal allows closed syllables to occur anywhere within the word instead of limiting them to word-final position: for example *mickackaʔ* 'between' is syllabified as /mic.kac.kaʔ/, consisting of three closed syllables.

Matu'uwal consonants are less restricted in their distribution than in other Atayal dialects. Matu'uwal allows both /b/ and /g/ to occur in word-final position: *humab* 'to stab (AV)', *bicug* 'worm'. The affricate /c/ cannot occur word-finally: it merges with /t/, as detailed in @sec:merger-final-c-t. Unlike most Atayal dialects, Matu'uwal does allow /x/ to occur in word-initial position. [@li1981, p. 240] identified only two lexical items with initial /x/, *xuwil* 'dog' and *xuxuʔ* 'breasts', and I have not encountered any other examples.

Matu'uwal does not lenite all prepenultimate vowels, unlike Squliq, S'uli', C'uli', and Skikun. It preserves vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, as shown in @tbl:matuuwal-antepenult-vowels.

: Vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable in Matu'uwal {#tbl:matuuwal-antepenult-vowels}

| Matu'uwal  | Gloss            |
|------------|------------------|
| t*a*nguqiy | 'horn'           |
| p*i*saniq  | 'taboo'          |
| t*u*rakis  | 'foxtail millet' |

There are still vowel reduction processes of a different nature in Matu'uwal, which are discussed in [@sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution; @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng].

Schwa in Matu'uwal appears almost exclusively in initial open syllables: *bəhut* 'squirrel', *kəgiy* 'hemp', *həmaʔ* 'tongue'. There are very rare exceptions to this tendency: *mantəhawnak* 'to sit (AV)', *sumanmənahuqil* 'to kill (AV)'; but in these cases the syllable carrying the schwa immediately follows a morpheme boundary. Usually a word-medial schwa is deleted, leading to a non-final closed syllable; this is addressed in @sec:historical-schwa-alternations.

### Plngawan

#### Plngawan consonant inventory

Plngawan Atayal is spoken in a single village in Ren'ai township, Nantou county. There used to be three separate villages all speaking the same dialect, but they were relocated to their current location in the first half of the 20th century, during Japanese rule. Differences between subdialects do exists, but are mostly lexical, and do not extend to the consonant inventory [@chen2012, pp. 2-4].

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Plngawan Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:plngawan-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p     & t        & k      &       & ' [ʔ] \\
b [b\char`~β] &        & g [g\char`~ɣ] &       &       \\
      & c [ts]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h     &       \\
m     & n        & ng [ŋ] &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j], ɹ &        &       &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Plngawan lacks a /q/ phoneme, but preserves the distinction between /s/ and /c/. It is the only dialect to have an alveolar approximant phoneme /ɹ/ distinct from other approximants. This phoneme contrasts with /r/, phonetically an alveolar tap, or more rarely a trill. Both phonemes have no restrictions on where in a word they can appear.

Plngawan voiced obstruents /b/ and /g/ may be realized as either plosives [b] and [g] or fricatives [β] and [ɣ], respectively. The fricative pronunciation tends to occur in intervocalic position. Li [-@li1985, p. 700] wrote that all Atayal dialects except Plngawan pronounce /b/ and /g/ as fricatives, however in my fieldwork I have also encountered plosive pronunciations from speakers of C'uli' (@sec:culi-consonants) and Skikun (@sec:skikun-consonants).

The phoneme /h/ is not as strongly pharyngeal as in other Atayal dialects, and appears to be merging with /x/. During my fieldwork, I noticed that the difference between /h/ and /x/ is not always very clear, and /h/ is sometimes pronounced as a velar fricative [x], especially before high or mid vowels. The speakers themselves do not always differentiate between them reliably. The two phonemes are more clearly distinguished in word-final position. The phoneme /h/ can also be realized as a pharyngeal [ħ] or glottal fricative [h].

The alveolar approximant /ɹ/ in word-final position may sometimes be realized as [l], merging with /l/. This does not happen consistently, even for the same speaker.

#### Plngawan vowel inventory

Plngawan has a five-vowel inventory, shown in @tbl:plngawan-vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Plngawan Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:plngawan-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
e     &        & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ occur in Plngawan quite frequently, in part due to widespread vowel coalescence (@sec:vowel-coalescence). Schwa does not appear in this dialect, and instances of historical schwa were merged into cardinal vowels (most frequently /a/, but also others), or were deleted. See @sec:historical-schwa-alternations for more information on alternations of historical schwa.

#### Plngawan phonotactics

Plngawan has a relatively simple syllable structure, as shown in examples in @tbl:plngawan-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in Plngawan Atayal {#tbl:plngawan-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| CV            | ʔu.tux  | 'one'     |
| CVC           | baʔ     | 'to know' |
| CGVC          | ryung   | 'hornet'  |

Chen [-@chen2012, p. 24] lists examples with onsetless syllables, such as /ra.gi.il/ 'narrow', /hu.la.iy/ 'snow', and /ba.iy/ 'thyroid gland'.^[Chen uses the symbol /j/ in her transcription of the palatal glide [j], but I use /y/ here for internal consistency.] In my fieldwork, I heard clear glottal stops in the elicitation of all these examples, so they should be transcribed instead as /ɹa.gi.ʔil/^[Chen has an initial /r/ in her transcription, but this word should start with /ɹ/ instead.] 'narrow', /hu.la.ʔiy/ 'snow', and /ba.ʔiy/ 'thyroid gland'. Conversely, Chen writes /sa.ʔiŋ/ 'two', where the glottal stop appears to be optional in my data. However, unlike Matu'uwal (@sec:matuuwal-phonotactics), Plngawan has no phonemic distinction between a hiatus and two vowels with an intervening glottal stop, so I analyze all these examples as having a phonemic glottal stop.

There are very few good examples of CGVC syllables, with the best one given in @tbl:plngawan-syllable-types. I have not been able to find any examples at all with the approximants /w/ and /ɹ/ in my dataset, so the glide in this syllable type appears to be limited to /y/. Chen's [-@chen2012, p. 24] examples /ta.ra.hjaʔ/ 'to lie down' and /si.njuw/ 'rope' can alternatively be analyzed as /ta.rah.jaʔ/ and /sin.juw/, respectively, with the syllable boundary between the consonant and the glide. Examples with the phonemes /c/ or /s/ such as Chen's /ʔu.cjux/ are not pronounced as two separate segments, but instead coalesce into a single palatal segment [tɕ] or [ɕ], respectively. Underlyingly, they should still be treated as separate phonemes based on alternations such as *sumyuw* [sumjuː] 'to make rope (AV)' vs *syugun* [ɕuɣun] 'to make rope (PV.SBJV)'. This pair shows that /s/ and /y/ are separate phonemes based on the position of the infix *-um-*: if there were a distinct phoneme /sy/, we would expect the infixed form to be \*\**syumuw*. In the suffixed form *syugun*, the phonemes /s/ and /y/ are phonetically merged into a single segment [ɕ], and thus belong in the same syllable.

Plngawan preserves vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, as shown in @tbl:plngawan-antepenult-vowels. These vowels are often the same as in Matu'uwal, though sometimes they are not; these differences are explored further in Section XXX.
<!-- TODO: link section -->

: Vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable in Plngawan {#tbl:plngawan-antepenult-vowels}

| Plngawan  | Gloss            |
|-----------|------------------|
| n*a*karit | 'spider'         |
| p*i*saniʔ | 'taboo'          |
| t*u*rakis | 'foxtail millet' |

Vowels in the third-to-last position do get reduced in Plngawan under certain circumstances, this is discussed in @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng.

Chen [-@chen2012, p. 3] notes that one of the main differences between the Macagis and Samiru subdialects of Plngawan is their syllable structure: Samiru allows heterosyllabic consonant clusters, while Macagis has an intervening /a/ vowel in these words, e.g. Samiru *kilkah* vs Macagis *kilakah* 'kick'. The vowel is always /a/, and Chen treats it as an epenthetic vowel in Macagis in order to avoid a heterosyllabic CC cluster, i.e. Macagis disallows non-final CVC syllables. My analysis is that this difference is caused by a difference in sound changes of \*ə in this environment, see @sec:historical-schwa-alternations.

<!-- ʔ cannot appear in word-internal codas -->

Word-final /ay/ is very rare, because Plngawan underwent a change whereby \*ay became /iː/ word-finally (see Section XXX). It can be found in a few words, such as *cubay* 'very much, truly' or *kakumay* 'caterpillar'.
<!-- TODO: add section link -->

<!-- TODO: word-final bilabials > velars -->

I have collected some examples of what appear to be syllabic nasals in Plngawan. The dialect has a derivational prefix *m-* which is used in agentive nominalizations, e.g. *mpulataʔ* 'hunter', *mpumaɹah* 'farmer', *mpakuriʔ* 'thief', *mpurahuʔ* 'shaman'. This prefix is pronounced as a separate syllable, but the mouth remains fully closed for the entire duration. This phenomenon would benefit from further investigation.

#### C'uli' vowel inventory

C'uli' distinguishes five vowel phonemes plus a quasi-phonemic schwa, as shown in @tbl:culi-vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{C'uli' Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:culi-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
e     & (ə)    & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Schwa cannot appear in the final (stressed) syllable, but is allowed everywhere else. The cardinal vowel phonemes /a i u e o/ normally only appear in final syllables or in penultimate open syllables, though they are sometimes allowed in other positions. The distribution of schwa is not completely predictable. These issues are explored further in @sec:culi-phonotactics.

#### C'uli' phonotactics {#sec:culi-phonotactics}

C'uli' allows both closed and open syllables in final and non-final positions, although non-final closed syllables do have some restrictions, as discussed further below. Syllables are maximally CGVC, and all syllable types with examples can be seen in @tbl:culi-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in C'uli' Atayal {#tbl:culi-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss       |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| CV            | ma.su   | 'to finish' |
| CVC           | bes     | 'spouse'    |
| CGV           | mya.sa  | 'good'      |
| CGVC          | lwax    | 'pillar'    |

Non-final closed syllables are allowed in C'uli', though they are not common. Apart from reduplicated onomatopoetic words (*pyongpyong* 'hare', *bengbeng* 'cricket') and loanwords (*məzyungbang* 'to prepare', from Japanese 準備 *junbi*), the vowel in these syllables will always be a schwa, as demonstrated in @tbl:nonfinal-closed-syll-culi.

: Non-final closed syllables in C'uli' {#tbl:nonfinal-closed-syll-culi}

| C'uli'       | Gloss                   |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| hək.ha.ni    | 'to look for'           |
| məs.tə.na    | 'to meet, to encounter' |
| məs.lə.pyung | 'to befriend'           |
| sə.mə.ʔa.tuʔ | 'head cold'             |

In *məstəna* 'to meet' and *məsləpyung* 'to befriend', *məs-* is a derivational prefix that indicates a change of state; but *həkhani* 'to look for' does not appear to have any affixation. The latter suggests that heterosyllabic consonant clusters are not limited to morpheme boundaries. In all of the aforementioned three words, the closed syllable is third-to-last, which may suggest a vowel syncope rule in the environment VC\_CV. This hypothesis is disproved by the example *səməʔatuʔ* 'head cold', which shows that a schwa can appear in such a position. This means that the distribution of schwa in C'uli' may not be fully predictable. The problem of the distribution of schwa in C'uli' will not be addressed further in this dissertation, but it does merit further research.
<!-- It can also appear as *məsə-*, for example in *məsəsya* 'to melt' (from *ʔəsya* 'water') 
Or is the schwa here part of the root? Can't tell. -->

C'uli' differentiates between monosyllabic CG sequences and those with an intervening schwa vowel, e.g. the near minimal pair [sə.nə.wa] 'loud' and [sə.nwan] 'to face something'. This phenomenon appears similar to one found in Squliq, as described in @sec:squliq-vowels.

C'uli' only has vowel distinctions in the final two syllables in its native vocabulary. This is a feature common to several Atayal dialects, and is discussed at length in @sec:prepen-vowel-weakening.

As in S'uli' (@sec:suli-phonotactics), the functional load of final glottal stops in C'uli' appears to be greatly reduced, if it exists at all. My language consultant failed to perceive any distinction between words that are expected to have final glottal stops and words that are expected to have final open syllables (based on cognates with other Atayal dialects). On one occasion, the speaker insisted on a long vowel in a word where a final glottal stop would be expected, e.g. [la.ʔiː] 'child', cf. Matu'uwal *ʔulaqiʔ*, Squliq *ʔəlaqiʔ*, Skikun *laqiʔ*, Matu'aw *ʔulaʔiʔ*, Plngawan *ʔuleʔ*. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no audible glottal stop nor any noticeable vowel lengthening in such words. Therefore, I treat C'uli' as having final open syllables and no word-final glottal stops.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Paul Li [-@li1980, p. 375] noted as early as 40 years ago that Skikun /g/ may be devoiced into [x] before consonants and is always voiceless in word-final position (identified as historical \*g using comparisons with other dialects). In my own fieldwork, I noticed this pronunciation and more: /g/ tended to be devoiced word-initially, and /x/ tended to be voiced intervocalically (note that /x/ does not occur in word-initial position, as in most Atayal dialects). As such, there may be no reason to posit /g/ and /x/ as separate phonemes if they are no longer meaningfully distinguished in the language. However, this dissertation will not address the issue further. The reader should be aware that any difference between /g/ and /x/ in Skikun is **unreliable** and subject to variation.

The phonemes /n/ and /l/ are not always differentiated in word-final position. My language consultant was mostly consistent with expected reflexes, but occasionally either hypercorrected /n/ to /l/ (e.g. *rawil* 'cousin' instead of expected *rawin*) or hypocorrected /l/ to /n/ (e.g. *məxan* 'to be sick, to be in pain' instead of expected *məxal*, cf. suffixed form *kəxalun* 'to hurt'). This is most likely part of a larger trend to merge word-final /l/ into /n/, which is common among younger Atayal speakers of various dialects.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

#### Skikun phonotactics

byaq 'worm'
qwas 'song'

Schwa is pervasive in Skikun, and follows every consonant that does not have a following cardinal vowel. As such, non-final closed syllables in Skikun are only allowed on morpheme boundaries, for example using the perfective infix *-in-*: *kinholan* 'place of origin, home village'.^[There is at least one content word in the native vocabulary that appears to violate this principle: *kinpahux* 'pit viper'. Skikun does have a verbal root *pahux* 'to snap, to break', so *kinpahux* in the meaning of 'pit viper' can be argued to be a derived form, albeit with no traceable semantic link.] Other affixes that can form a closed syllable include *cin-* (multiple meanings), *kin-* 'extremely', *min-* 'N times'.

The only word-final open syllables in Skikun are those with the vowel /i/, where it undergoes compensatory lengthening: *bənaqiy* 'sand', *həlaqiy* 'snow'.
