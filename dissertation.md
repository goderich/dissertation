# Phonologies of Atayal dialects

This chapter presents a synchronic overview of the phonologies of the seven dialects discussed in the dissertation: Squliq, S'uli', Matu'uwal, Plngawan, C'uli', Skikun, and Matu'aw. Some of these, like Squliq and Matu'uwal, are comparatively well-researched. Others, like C'uli' and Matu'aw, have received almost no attention in linguistic studies.

@sec:phoneme-inventories-phonotactics discusses the consonant inventories, vowel inventories, and phonotactics (syllable types, phoneme restrictions) of each dialect separately. @sec:synchronic-alternations discusses synchronic alternations in the different dialects together, in part because many of them are similar, and in part to provide a comparative overview.

## Phoneme inventories and phonotactics {#sec:phoneme-inventories-phonotactics}

The consonant inventories of the various Atayal dialects are mostly very similar to each other. The major differences are in the presence of absence of /q/ and /c/ phonemes, which in some dialects merge with /ʔ/ and /s/, respectively.

In the following sections, I will describe the consonant inventories of seven Atayal dialects separately, providing specifics of articulation where appropriate.

**Stress in all Atayal dialects in this study is always word-final**, and is not discussed separately for each dialect. It is realized as a pitch drop, and stressed syllables also have a higher intensity. Penultimate syllables tend to have a rising pitch in anticipation of the final pitch drop. I believe it is this rising pitch in penultimate syllables that led some linguists to occasionally hear penultimate stress, especially when pronounced in an utterance [@li1981, p. 239;@chen2011, p. 32].

### Squliq

#### Squliq consonant inventory

Squliq is the biggest Atayal dialect in terms of the number of speakers and the geographical area over which it is spoken. There is inevitably a certain amount of phonetic variation in Squliq spoken in various geographically separate locations. Nevertheless, the differences between varieties of Squliq do not extend to the consonant inventory. @tbl:squliq-consonants presents the consonant phonemes of Squliq.
<!-- TODO: there are dialects in I-lan which are likely Squliq but merged q into ʔ (see li1998). I should talk about them somewhere. -->

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Squliq Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:squliq-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p     & t        & k      & q     & ' [ʔ] \\
b [v] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & c [ts]   &        &       &       \\

w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Squliq preserves /q/ and /ʔ/ as separate phonemes. The voiced labial obstruent /b/ is most often realized as a voiced labiodental fricative [v], but can also be a voiced bilabial fricative [β] in the speech of older and more conservative speakers.

The phoneme /c/ is not found in the dialect as a distinct root-internal phoneme, but coronal affricates can still appear in the dialect in several situations: (1) as an allophone of /t/ before the high front vowel /i/ or the palatal approximant /y/, (2) as an allophone of /t/ in word-final position, and (3) in the derivational prefix *c-* [@egerod1966, p. 123;@li1980, pp. 362-363].

In the first case, it is fully in complementary distribution with the plosive [t], and can be analyzed as an allophone of the phoneme /t/ directly preceding the vowel /i/ or the glide /y/. Note that while orthographically it is still written as \<c\>, phonetically it is an alveolo-palatal affricate [tɕ].

Word-final /t/ may also be affricated as [ts] in the speech of some Squliq speakers, and this is sometimes reflected in writing [@huang2016a, p. 12]. This is a purely phonetic feature and has no bearing on the phonological system of the dialect.

The derivational prefix *c-* is what makes /c/ a phoneme. This prefix forms causative and reciprocal verbs, among other functions [@rau1992, pp. 102-104;@hayung2008, sec. 2.8]: e.g. *c-* + *baq* 'to know' > *cbaq* 'to teach', *c-* + *beng* 'to grasp' > *cbeng* 'to grasp each other'. Phonetically speaking, it is followed by a schwa vowel, so *cbaq* 'to teach' is pronounced [tsə.ˈvaq]. The prefix *c-* contrasts with another derivational prefix *t-* [@hayung2008], so they cannot be analyzed as allophones here.

The status of /z/, phonetically a voiced alveolo-palatal fricative [ʑ], was addressed by @huang2015a, who examined its distribution relative to /y/ in several varieties of Squliq. Huang's conclusion was that the two sounds are in complementary distribution in some varieties of Squliq, but minimally contrastive in others [@huang2015a, p. 254]. Even in varieties that show a distinction between /z/ and /y/, there are no minimal pairs, and the phonemic status of /z/ remains marginal.

#### Squliq vowel inventory {#sec:squliq-vowels}

The vowel system of Squliq Atayal has traditionally been analyzed as /a i u e o/ [@egerod1966;@li1980;@huang2006a;@huang2016a]. The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ are much rarer than the vowels /i u a/, and they correspond to VG sequences /ay/ and /aw/ in some varieties of Squliq and other Atayal dialects [@li1980, pp. 354-355]. The high vowels /i/ and /u/ are centralized when adjacent to post-dorsal consonants /q/ and /h/, and may be perceived and written as mid vowels instead. <!-- TODO cite -->

On the other hand, almost no studies treat [ə] as a phoneme, and it is instead considered a purely phonetic vowel that breaks up underlying consonant clusters [@li1980, p. 355]. @yamada1974 do analyze it as a phoneme, but also note that its distribution is constrained to unstressed (non-final) syllables. @chien2001 presents data that constitutes near-minimal pairs of CG and CəG sequences, e.g. *hwa.hun* 'to destroy (PV)' vs *hə.wa.kun* 'to support by the arm (PV)'. @huang2014 treats these distinctions as stemming from glides being in the nucleus or the onset, but here I shall instead treat schwa as a marginal phoneme based on Cheng's examples.
<!-- TODO: create citation for cheng2001 from huang 2014 -->

The vowel inventory of Squliq Atayal as analyzed here is presented in @tbl:squliq-vowels. The vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ are fully phonemic, while the central vowel /ə/ has a more limited distribution, and is treated as a marginal phoneme.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Squliq Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:squliq-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
e     & (ə)    & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This analysis is different from the commonly used analyses of the Squliq vowel system. The main difference is in the inclusion of /ə/, albeit as a quasi-phoneme due to its limited distribution: it is not able to receive stress and is the 'default' vowel that other vowels are lenited to. The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ can be analyzed as phonemic in some varieties of Squliq, but are absent from others [@li1980, pp. 354-355]. The varieties that do not have /e/ and /o/ phonemes will instead have VG or GV sequences in corresponding positions.

#### Squliq phonotactics

Squliq disallows true consonant clusters [@huang2006a]. Any apparent tautosyllabic consonant clusters have an intervening schwa vowel that is unwritten in the orthography of the language. Tautosyllabic CG sequences can be found, but are not consonant clusters: the glide in these sequences phonologically behaves like a vowel, and is therefore analyzed as part of the nucleus [@huang2006a, sec. 5].

The syllable types of Squliq Atayal are presented in @tbl:squliq-syllable-types. The table includes only those syllable types which are found across different varieties of Squliq. Some varieties allow more complex syllable structure, as discussed below.

: Syllable types in Squliq Atayal {#tbl:squliq-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss             |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| CV            | qu.tux  | 'one'             |
| CGV           | qwa.lax | 'rain'            |
| CVC           | baq     | 'to know'         |
| CGVC          | qwaw    | 'alcoholic drink' |

<!-- TODO: add syllable types that occur in part of Squliq variants -->
When open syllables occur word-finally, the vowel is lengthened, for example *bisuw* [vi.ˈsuː] 'worm'. These syllables can alternatively be analyzed as CVG with a homorganic glide coda [@huang2006a, p. 61]. The vowels in these syllables are limited to /i/ and /u/, and the syllables can only occur in word-final position. The vowel length in these syllables comes from an original consonantal coda, which lenited and is no longer found in Squliq [@li1981, sec. 2.8]. The same syllable type can be seen in all dialects of Atayal, with the same or similar origin.
<!-- TODO: add link to reconstruction chapter -->

There are variations in the phonotactics of Squliq in different regions. Huang [-@huang2006a, p. 66] notes that Taoshan Squliq allows root-internal codas and word-final CVGC syllables, but Jianshi Squliq does not. @tbl:squliq-syllable-types includes only syllable types found in all varieties of Squliq.

Some Squliq consonants have a limited distribution. The phoneme /x/ cannot occur word-initially [@li1981, p. 239]. The phonemes /b/ and /g/ cannot occur word-finally, and neither can the quasi-phoneme /z/ [@li1981, p. 240]. @li1981 also claimed that /r/ was disallowed in word-final position in Squliq, but Huang [-@huang2006a, p. 64] listed several counterexamples with word-final /r/ in Taoshan Squliq. Even though /r/ can appear word-finally, it is extremely rare in this position, and is replaced with /l/ by some speakers.

The voiceless dental plosive /t/ is affricated before a high front vowel /i/ or the corresponding glide /y/, as seen in @tbl:squliq-t-affrication.

: Affrication of /t/ in Squliq {#tbl:squliq-t-affrication}

| Word   | Transcription | Gloss   |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| cimuʔ  | [tɕi.ˈmuʔ]    | 'salt'  |
| cyugal | [tɕu.ˈgal]    | 'three' |

This behaviour can be analyzed as an allophone of the phoneme /t/, or as the phoneme /c/ occurring in complementary distribution with /t/ in this environment. Diachronically speaking, /t/ is in the middle of a split, so both interpretations are possible at this time.

The phoneme /k/ followed by /q/ or /h/ in the same word in other dialects, in Squliq corresponds to /q/ instead. In other words, Squliq tends to avoid /k..q/ or /k..h/ sequences in the same word, though they are not disallowed entirely. See examples in @tbl:dorsal-harmony-squliq [from @li1980, p. 377].

: Dorsal harmony in Squliq {#tbl:dorsal-harmony-squliq}

| Squliq  | S'uli'  | Matu'uwal | Gloss        |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| qəhuniq | kahuniʔ | kahuniq   | 'tree'       |
| qətəhuy | katahuy | kithuw    | 'fat, thick' |

Both words in Squliq have an initial /q/ phoneme, but begin with a /k/ in both S'uli' and Matu'uwal. The final phoneme in 'tree' is /q/ in Squliq and Matu'uwal, and /ʔ/ in S'uli', which is the regular correspondence. Squliq underwent a process called *dorsal consonant harmony*, whereby a historical *k was backed into /q/ in some environments. This process also occurred in Skikun [@li1980, p. 377] and Seediq [@lee2009].
<!-- TODO: add link to regular correspondences and dorsal harmony -->

Some Squliq speakers do not allow /l/ to occur in word-final position, and replace it with /n/ [@rau2000]. This is a sound change in progress; it has not yet completed for all Squliq speakers. This merger can also be found in other Atayal dialects, see @sec:merger-final-l-n.

Squliq, like several other Atayal dialects, has a vowel weakening rule under which all vowel distinctions outside the rightmost foot are lost [@egerod1965, p. 255-257;@li1980, pp. 369-370]. This weakening rule is demonstrated in @sec:prepen-vowel-weakening. Put another way, this rule means that no vowels other than schwa can occur anywhere except the final two syllables. One exception in native Atayal vocabulary is the perfective infix *-in-* in some varieties of Squliq, where it retains its vowel regardless of its position within a word. Another exception is the interjection *talagay* 'wow!', which has a cardinal vowel in the third-to-last syllable.

### S'uli'

#### S'uli' consonant inventory

S'uli' is the second biggest Atayal dialect, and is spoken in Jianshih township and Wufeng township in Hsinchu county (新竹市尖石鄉、新竹市五峰鄉), Tai'an tonwnship in Miaoli county (苗栗縣泰安鄉), and Heping district in Taichung city (台中市和平區). Its consonant inventory, shown in @tbl:suli-consonants, is characterized by the lack of both /q/ and /c/ phonemes.
<!-- TODO: add somewhere that there is variation, sometimes quite significant, within S'uli', and perhaps it could be analyzed further as a subgroup -->

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{S'uli' Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:suli-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p     & t        & k      &       & ' [ʔ] \\
b [v] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ng [ŋ] &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

S'uli' has a voiced alveolo-palatal fricative [ʑ], which in my data is in complementary distribution with the glide [j]. These two sounds are likely allophones of /y/, but no research has been done on a possible phonemic distinction between the two. Here they are treated as allophones, but still distinguished in transcription.

The lateral approximant /l/ does not appear word-finally in S'uli' due to a merger with /n/ in this position (see @sec:merger-final-l-n).

There is some variation within S'uli', but due to frequent intermarriage between different S'uli' communities, it is not always easy to identify language features on a geographic basis. They are instead treated as individual speaker variations. Indeed, often speakers will provide two forms upon elicitation, either with variant pronunciation or else different lexical items, both of which can be used by S'uli' speakers.
<!-- TODO: maybe move this somewhere else? -->

One such variation is an affricate [tɕ] allophone of /t/ before the high front vowel /i/ or the corresponding semivowel /y/. Thus, the word 'salt' may be pronounced variously as *cimu* or *timu*, sometimes by the same speaker. Some speakers are very consistent with a single variant, for others the consistency may vary by lexical item. However, due to the large amount of variation between speakers, we cannot yet analyze this phenomenon as a phonemic split, though it could become one in the future.

#### S'uli' vowel inventory

The vowel inventory of Squliq Atayal is shown in @tbl:suli-vowels. There is variation between speakers, which is explained in more detail below.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{S'uli' Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:suli-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
(e)   & (ə)    & (o)   \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The mid vowels [e] and [o] appear in the speech of some speakers, but not others. For example, the word 'eyes' can be pronounced *rawzi*, *rowzi*, or *rozi*, with a range of [aw\~ow\~o] for the relevant sounds. This means that, depending on the speaker or variety, there may or may not be mid vowels /e/ and /o/ in the vowel inventory.

The vowel schwa does appear in the surface representation in the dialects that I have studied, however here there is also some variation. There appears to be some crossover with the vowel /a/, and sometimes the difference between the two is not very audible. Very often the pronunciation was in the range of [ɐ], that is, somewhere between a low an a central position, with the mouth more open than for a central vowel, but less so than for a stressed /a/ for the same speaker.
<!-- TODO: rethink this, because maybe [zya] (eg in *hzyan*) counts -->
<!-- One possible way to argue for a distinction is by observing their distribution relative to allophones of /y/: for example, in the word [ʑə.ma.ˈɣan] 'five' we see the [ʑ] realization, which does not occur before /a/. -->

#### S'uli' phonotactics {#sec:suli-phonotactics}

The syllable types common to all S'uli' varieties are shown in @tbl:suli-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in S'uli' Atayal {#tbl:suli-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss             |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| CV            | ʔu.tux  | 'one'             |
| CGV           | kya.hin | 'skin'            |
| CVC           | la.tan  | 'clothing'        |
| CGVC          | sway    | 'younger sibling' |

Some speakers have CVGC syllables, e.g. *rawm* 'needle', while other speakers coalesce the VG sequence into a mid vowel, as in *rom*.

Closed syllables are allowed in non-final positions, e.g. *ləmngalung* 'to think (AV)', *kəbhəni* 'bird'. Not all third-to-last vowels are deleted, cf. *məkərakis* 'young woman'.

S'uli' (at least for some speakers) has a contrast between *nya* (3S.Gen clitic pronoun) and *niya* (proximal progressive marker), where the presence or absence of a homorganic vowel before a glide is phonemic. I have not encountered such distinctions in other Atayal dialects.

Unlike most Atayal dialects, S'uli' does not distinguish open final syllables from final syllables ending in a glottal stop, i.e. there are no phonemic glottal stops in word-final position. Words that end with a phonemic /ʔ/ or /q/ in other dialects do not reliably show an audible glottal stop in my consultants' speech: *tari* 'knee', *kisi* 'k.o. basket', *rozi* 'eyes'. The only other Atayal dialect with the same phenomenon is C'uli' (see @sec:culi-phonotactics).

### Matu'uwal

#### Matu'uwal consonant inventory

Matu'uwal Atayal, spoken in three villages in Tai'an township, Miaoli county, has been described by researchers as 'conservative' [@li1981, p. 236;@huang2000, p. 364]. While this descriptor is overly broad, it is true for some aspects of its phonology, including its consonant inventory, shown in @tbl:matuuwal-consonants.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'uwal Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:matuuwal-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p     & t        & k      & q     & ' [ʔ] \\
b [β] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & c [ts]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ng [ŋ] &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Matu'uwal preserves historical /q/ and /c/ as separate phonemes, and is one of only two Atayal dialects to do so (the other being Skikun). Older speakers of Matu'uwal use the voiced bilabial fricative [β] pronunciation of the phoneme /b/. Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that allows the phonemes /b/ and /g/ to occur word-finally, see @sec:matuuwal-phonotactics for more details.

Matu'uwal spoken in Qing'an village (清安村) lacks the phoneme /c/, and it completely merged with /s/. My data comes from speakers in Jinshuei village (錦水村), whose dialect preserves the contrast between /c/ and /s/.

#### Matu'uwal vowel inventory

The vowel inventory of Matu'uwal is simpler than that of other dialects. @tbl:matuuwal-vowels presents the vowels of Matu'uwal.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'uwal Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:matuuwal-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
      & (ə)    &       \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Unlike most other Atayal dialects, Matu'uwal does not have any occurrences of mid vowels [e] and [o] in native vocabulary (though they may occur in Japanese or Sinitic loanwords). Instead, Matu'uwal will have VG sequences /ay/ and /aw/ or hiatuses /ai/ and /au/ where other dialects have mid vowels. @sec:matuuwal-phonotactics goes into more detail on Matu'uwal hiatuses.

Like Squliq, Matu'uwal allows the mid central vowel to occur in the surface representation, but it is quite rare. Matu'uwal does not reduce all prepenultimate vowels, and preserves vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, although it does have vowel reductions of a different kind, see @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng. Its appearance is restricted the initial open syllables, e.g. *bəhut* 'squirrel'.

#### Matu'uwal phonotactics {#sec:matuuwal-phonotactics}

Matu'uwal syllables are maximally CVC [@huang2015, pp. 58-59]. The full range of syllable types is rather small, and presented in @tbl:matuuwal-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in Matu'uwal Atayal {#tbl:matuuwal-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| CV            | qu.tux  | 'one'     |
| VC            | ra.an   | 'road'    |
| CVC           | baq     | 'to know' |

Just like in other Atayal dialects, the vowel in final open syllables is lengthened. Unlike other Atayal dialects, this vowel can be /a/, e.g. *taka* [ta.ˈkaː] 'frog, toad'. This makes it impossible to analyze final open syllables as having an underlying homorganic glide coda, since [a] does not have a corresponding glide [@huang2015, p. 61]. Open syllables in Matu'uwal are mostly due to the deletion of word-final Proto-Atayal \*ɹ. <!-- TODO: link corresponding chapter -->

Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that allows onsetless syllables, but these can only occur in word-final position. Similar to final open syllables, Matu'uwal **hiatuses**, or vowel clusters, are the result of the loss of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ. Hiatuses can be either two identical vowels (/a.a/, /i.i/, /u.u/), or a vowel sequence with decreasing sonority (/a.i/, /a.u/). Phonetically, these hiatuses are distinct from VG sequences: there are two audible syllable peaks; and stress, which is always word-final in all Atayal dialects, falls on the second vowel. The reason for this analysis is the difference in phonological behaviour between these two sets, see @sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution for a detailed explanation.
<!-- TODO: should i move the discussion of stress somewhere else? -->

Some studies describe CGVC or CVGC syllables in Matu'uwal [@lu2005], but here I agree with Huang [-@huang2015, p. 59] in analyzing them as disyllabic sequences CV.GVC or CV.VC.

Matu'uwal allows closed syllables to occur anywhere within the word instead of limiting them to word-final position: for example *mickackaʔ* 'between' is syllabified as /mic.kac.kaʔ/, consisting of three closed syllables.

Matu'uwal consonants are less restricted in their distribution than in other Atayal dialects. Matu'uwal allows both /b/ and /g/ to occur in word-final position: *humab* 'to stab (AV)', *bicug* 'worm'. The affricate /c/ cannot occur word-finally: it merges with /t/, as detailed in @sec:merger-final-c-t. Unlike most Atayal dialects, Matu'uwal does allow /x/ to occur in word-initial position. [@li1981, p. 240] identified only two lexical items with initial /x/, *xuwil* 'dog' and *xuxuʔ* 'breasts', and I have not encountered any other examples.

Matu'uwal does not lenite all prepenultimate vowels, unlike Squliq, S'uli', C'uli', and Skikun. It preserves vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, as shown in @tbl:matuuwal-antepenult-vowels.

: Vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable in Matu'uwal {#tbl:matuuwal-antepenult-vowels}

| Matu'uwal  | Gloss            |
|------------|------------------|
| t*a*nguqiy | 'horn'           |
| p*i*saniq  | 'taboo'          |
| t*u*rakis  | 'foxtail millet' |

There are still vowel reduction processes of a different nature in Matu'uwal, which are discussed in [@sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution; @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng].

Schwa in Matu'uwal appears almost exclusively in initial open syllables: *bəhut* 'squirrel', *kəgiy* 'hemp', *həmaʔ* 'tongue'. There are very rare exceptions to this tendency: *mantəhawnak* 'to sit (AV)', *sumanmənahuqil* 'to kill (AV)'; but in these cases the syllable carrying the schwa immediately follows a morpheme boundary. Usually a word-medial schwa is deleted, leading to a non-final closed syllable; this is addressed in @sec:historical-schwa-alternations.

### Plngawan

#### Plngawan consonant inventory {#sec:plngawan-consonants}

Plngawan Atayal is spoken in a single village in Ren'ai township, Nantou county. There used to be three separate villages all speaking the same dialect, but they were relocated to their current location in the first half of the 20th century, during Japanese rule. Differences between subdialects do exists, but are mostly lexical, and do not extend to the consonant inventory [@chen2012, pp. 2-4].

\end{table}

Plngawan lacks a /q/ phoneme, but preserves the distinction between /s/ and /c/. It is the only dialect to have an alveolar approximant phoneme /ɹ/ distinct from other approximants. This phoneme contrasts with /r/, phonetically an alveolar tap, or more rarely a trill. Both phonemes have no restrictions on where in a word they can appear.

Plngawan voiced obstruents /b/ and /g/ may be realized as either plosives [b] and [g] or fricatives [β] and [ɣ], respectively. The fricative pronunciation tends to occur in intervocalic position. Li [-@li1985, p. 700] wrote that all Atayal dialects except Plngawan pronounce /b/ and /g/ as fricatives, however in my fieldwork I have also encountered plosive pronunciations from speakers of C'uli' (@sec:culi-consonants) and Skikun (@sec:skikun-consonants).

The phoneme /h/ is not as strongly pharyngeal as in other Atayal dialects, and appears to be merging with /x/. During my fieldwork, I noticed that the difference between /h/ and /x/ is not always very clear, and /h/ is sometimes pronounced as a velar fricative [x], especially before high or mid vowels. The speakers themselves do not always differentiate between them reliably. The two phonemes are more clearly distinguished in word-final position. The phoneme /h/ can also be realized as a pharyngeal [ħ] or glottal fricative [h].

The alveolar approximant /ɹ/ in word-final position may sometimes be realized as [l], merging with /l/. This does not happen consistently, even for the same speaker.

#### Plngawan vowel inventory

Plngawan has a five-vowel inventory, shown in @tbl:plngawan-vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Plngawan Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:plngawan-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
e     &        & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ occur in Plngawan quite frequently, in part due to widespread vowel coalescence (@sec:vowel-coalescence). Schwa does not appear in this dialect, and instances of historical schwa were merged into cardinal vowels (most frequently /a/, but also others), or were deleted. See @sec:historical-schwa-alternations for more information on alternations of historical schwa.

#### Plngawan phonotactics {#sec:plngawan-phonotactics}

Plngawan has a relatively simple syllable structure, as shown in examples in @tbl:plngawan-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in Plngawan Atayal {#tbl:plngawan-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| CV            | ʔu.tux  | 'one'     |
| CVC           | baʔ     | 'to know' |
| CGVC          | ryung   | 'hornet'  |

Chen [-@chen2012, p. 24] lists examples with onsetless syllables, such as /ra.gi.il/ 'narrow', /hu.la.iy/ 'snow', and /ba.iy/ 'thyroid gland'.^[Chen uses the symbol /j/ in her transcription of the palatal glide [j], but I use /y/ here for internal consistency.] In my fieldwork, I heard clear glottal stops in the elicitation of all these examples, so they should be transcribed instead as /ɹa.gi.ʔil/^[Chen has an initial /r/ in her transcription, but this word should start with /ɹ/ instead.] 'narrow', /hu.la.ʔiy/ 'snow', and /ba.ʔiy/ 'thyroid gland'. Conversely, Chen writes /sa.ʔiŋ/ 'two', where the glottal stop appears to be optional in my data. However, unlike Matu'uwal (@sec:matuuwal-phonotactics), Plngawan has no phonemic distinction between a hiatus and two vowels with an intervening glottal stop, so I analyze all these examples as having a phonemic glottal stop.

There are very few good examples of CGVC syllables, with the best one given in @tbl:plngawan-syllable-types. I have not been able to find any examples at all with the approximants /w/ and /ɹ/ in my dataset, so the glide in this syllable type appears to be limited to /y/. Chen's [-@chen2012, p. 24] examples /ta.ra.hjaʔ/ 'to lie down' and /si.njuw/ 'rope' can alternatively be analyzed as /ta.rah.jaʔ/ and /sin.juw/, respectively, with the syllable boundary between the consonant and the glide. Examples with the phonemes /c/ or /s/ such as Chen's /ʔu.cjux/ are not pronounced as two separate segments, but instead coalesce into a single palatal segment [tɕ] or [ɕ], respectively. Underlyingly, they should still be treated as separate phonemes based on alternations such as *sumyuw* [sumjuː] 'to make rope (AV)' vs *syugun* [ɕuɣun] 'to make rope (PV.SBJV)'. This pair shows that /s/ and /y/ are separate phonemes based on the position of the infix *-um-*: if there were a distinct phoneme /sy/, we would expect the infixed form to be \*\**syumuw*. In the suffixed form *syugun*, the phonemes /s/ and /y/ are phonetically merged into a single segment [ɕ], and thus belong in the same syllable.

Plngawan preserves vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, as shown in @tbl:plngawan-antepenult-vowels. These vowels are often the same as in Matu'uwal, though sometimes they are not; these differences are explored further in Section XXX.
<!-- TODO: link section -->

: Vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable in Plngawan {#tbl:plngawan-antepenult-vowels}

| Plngawan  | Gloss            |
|-----------|------------------|
| n*a*karit | 'spider'         |
| p*i*saniʔ | 'taboo'          |
| t*u*rakis | 'foxtail millet' |

Vowels outside the head foot do get reduced in Plngawan under certain circumstances, this is discussed in @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng.

Chen [-@chen2012, p. 3] notes that one of the main differences between the Macagis and Samiru subdialects of Plngawan is their syllable structure: Samiru allows heterosyllabic consonant clusters, while Macagis has an intervening /a/ vowel in these words, e.g. Samiru *kilkah* vs Macagis *kilakah* 'kick'. The vowel is always /a/, and Chen treats it as an epenthetic vowel in Macagis in order to avoid a heterosyllabic CC cluster, i.e. Macagis disallows non-final CVC syllables. My analysis is that this difference is caused by a difference in sound changes of \*ə in this environment, see @sec:historical-schwa-alternations.

<!-- ʔ cannot appear in word-internal codas -->

Word-final /ay/ is very rare, because Plngawan underwent a change whereby \*ay became /iː/ word-finally (see Section XXX). It can be found in a few words, such as *cubay* 'very much, truly' or *kakumay* 'caterpillar'.
<!-- TODO: add section link -->

<!-- TODO: word-final bilabials > velars -->

I have collected some examples of what appear to be syllabic nasals in Plngawan. The dialect has a derivational prefix *m-* which is used in agentive nominalizations, e.g. *mpulataʔ* 'hunter', *mpumaɹah* 'farmer', *mpakuriʔ* 'thief', *mpurahuʔ* 'shaman'. This prefix is pronounced as a separate syllable, but the mouth remains fully closed for the entire duration. This phenomenon would benefit from further investigation.

### C'uli'

#### C'uli' consonant inventory {#sec:culi-consonants}

The consonant inventory of C'uli' is given in @tbl:culi-consonants. This dialect does not have /q/ as a phoneme, but distinguishes /c/ and /s/.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{C'uli' Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:culi-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p     & t        & k      &       & ' [ʔ] \\
b [β] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & c [ts]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ng [ŋ] &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

C'uli' does not allow bilabial consonants /b/, /m/, or /p/ to appear in word-final position. This is discussed in @sec:merger-labial-velar.

Likewise, /l/ does not occur word-finally either in my dataset, see @sec:merger-final-l-n for more details. It should be noted that my data comes from Pyahaw village (碧候), one of five villages where C'uli' is spoken. @li1998 includes data from all five villages, and in his data Ropoy (金岳) and Kngyan (金洋) do have final /l/, so this is not common to all C'uli' speakers.
<!-- TODO: cite li 1998? and  chen 2011 for both of these -->

The phoneme /k/ may be backed by some speakers. Its phonetic realization is sometimes uvular [q], but not consistently. There is only one dorsal plosive phoneme in C'uli', but its pronunciation may vary.

The voiced obstruents /b/ and /g/ are normally pronounced as voiced fricatives [β] (or [v]) and [ɣ], respectively. This was assumed to be true for all Atayal dialects with the exception of Plngawan [@li1981;@li1985]. However I did notice and record plosive variants [b] and [g] in C'uli' as well as Skikun (see @sec:skikun-consonants).

#### C'uli' vowel inventory

C'uli' distinguishes five vowel phonemes plus a quasi-phonemic schwa, as shown in @tbl:culi-vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{C'uli' Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:culi-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
e     & (ə)    & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Schwa cannot appear in the final (stressed) syllable, but is allowed everywhere else. The cardinal vowel phonemes /a i u e o/ normally only appear in final syllables or in penultimate open syllables, though they are sometimes allowed in other positions, e.g. in reduplicated monolyllables or in loanwords. The distribution of schwa is not completely predictable. These issues are explored further in @sec:culi-phonotactics.

#### C'uli' phonotactics {#sec:culi-phonotactics}

C'uli' allows both closed and open syllables in final and non-final positions, although non-final closed syllables do have some restrictions, as discussed further below. Syllables are maximally CGVC, and all syllable types with examples can be seen in @tbl:culi-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in C'uli' Atayal {#tbl:culi-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss       |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| CV            | ma.su   | 'to finish' |
| CVC           | bes     | 'spouse'    |
| CGV           | mya.sa  | 'good'      |
| CGVC          | lwax    | 'pillar'    |

Non-final closed syllables are allowed in C'uli', though they are not common. Apart from reduplicated onomatopoetic words (*pyongpyong* 'hare', *bengbeng* 'cricket') and loanwords (*məzyungbang* 'to prepare', from Japanese 準備 *junbi*), the vowel in these syllables will always be a schwa, as demonstrated in @tbl:nonfinal-closed-syll-culi.

: Non-final closed syllables in C'uli' {#tbl:nonfinal-closed-syll-culi}

| C'uli'       | Gloss                   |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| hək.ha.ni    | 'to look for'           |
| məs.tə.na    | 'to meet, to encounter' |
| məs.lə.pyung | 'to befriend'           |
| sə.mə.ʔa.tuʔ | 'head cold'             |

In *məstəna* 'to meet' and *məsləpyung* 'to befriend', *məs-* is a derivational prefix that indicates a change of state; but *həkhani* 'to look for' does not appear to have any affixation. The latter suggests that heterosyllabic consonant clusters are not limited to morpheme boundaries. In all of the aforementioned three words, the closed syllable is third-to-last, which may suggest a vowel syncope rule in the environment VC\_CV. This hypothesis is disproved by the example *səməʔatuʔ* 'head cold', which shows that a schwa can appear in such a position. This means that the distribution of schwa in C'uli' may not be fully predictable. The problem of the distribution of schwa in C'uli' will not be addressed further in this dissertation, but it does merit further research.
<!-- It can also appear as *məsə-*, for example in *məsəsya* 'to melt' (from *ʔəsya* 'water')
Or is the schwa here part of the root? Can't tell. -->

C'uli' differentiates between monosyllabic CG sequences and those with an intervening schwa vowel, e.g. the near minimal pair [sə.nə.wa] 'loud' and [sə.nwan] 'to face something'. This phenomenon appears similar to one found in Squliq, as described in @sec:squliq-vowels.

There is also a partial merger of /n/ or /l/ with /ŋ/ in word-final position in my data. This has not been reported in previous publications, but my language consultant sometimes merged a final /n/ or /l/ into /ŋ/ when it was preceded by the vowel /i/: C'uli *kyabing* 'swallow (bird sp.)', cf. Squliq and Skikun *kyabil*; C'uli' *səbing* 'lunchbox', cf. Matu'uwal and Squliq *səbil*. This is not consistent, and other words do show final /in/, e.g. *kənerin* 'woman', *yamin* 'footwear', *kyahin* 'skin'. This does mean that in my dataset, C'uli' will sometimes have a final /ŋ/ where an /n/ would be expected.

C'uli' only has vowel distinctions in the final two syllables in its native vocabulary. This is a feature common to several Atayal dialects, and is discussed at length in @sec:prepen-vowel-weakening.

As in S'uli' (@sec:suli-phonotactics), the functional load of final glottal stops in C'uli' appears to be greatly reduced, if it exists at all. My language consultant failed to perceive any distinction between words that are expected to have final glottal stops and words that are expected to have final open syllables (based on cognates with other Atayal dialects). On one occasion, the speaker insisted on a long vowel in a word where a final glottal stop would be expected, e.g. [la.ʔiː] 'child', cf. Matu'uwal *ʔulaqiʔ*, Squliq *ʔəlaqiʔ*, Skikun *laqiʔ*, Matu'aw *ʔulaʔiʔ*, Plngawan *ʔuleʔ*. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no audible glottal stop nor any noticeable vowel lengthening in such words. Therefore, I treat C'uli' as having final open syllables and no word-final glottal stops.

### Skikun

#### Skikun consonant inventory {#sec:skikun-consonants}

The consonant inventory of Skikun is presented in @tbl:skikun-consonants. The phonemes /x/ and /g/ may be undergoing a merger, see discussion further below.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Skikun Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:skikun-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p     & t        & k      & q     & ' [ʔ] \\
b [b\char`~β] &  & g\text{*} [ɣ] &       &       \\
      & c [ts]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x\text{*}    & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ng [ŋ] &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Paul Li [-@li1980, p. 375] noted as early as 40 years ago that Skikun /g/ may be devoiced into [x] before consonants and is always voiceless in word-final position (identified as historical \*g using comparisons with other dialects). Chen [-@chen2011, p. 26] noted word-initial devoicing as well, although she analyzed it as instances of word-initial /x/. In my own fieldwork, I noticed this pronunciation and more: /g/ tended to be devoiced word-initially, and /x/ tended to be voiced intervocalically. As such, there may be no reason to posit /g/ and /x/ as separate phonemes if they are no longer meaningfully distinguished in the language. However, this dissertation will not address the issue further. The reader should be aware that any difference between /g/ and /x/ in Skikun is **unreliable** and subject to variation.

The phonemes /n/ and /l/ are not always differentiated in word-final position. My language consultant was mostly consistent with expected reflexes, but occasionally either hypercorrected /n/ to /l/ (e.g. *rawil* 'cousin' instead of expected *rawin*) or hypocorrected /l/ to /n/ (e.g. *məxan* 'to be sick, to be in pain' instead of expected *məxal*, cf. suffixed form *kəxalun* 'to hurt'). This is most likely part of a larger trend to merge word-final /l/ into /n/, which is common among younger Atayal speakers of various dialects.

I also noticed a variant pronunciation of the phoneme /b/ during my fieldwork. Normally it is pronounced as either a voiced bilabial fricative [β] or a labiodental one [v], as was assumed to be the case throughout Atayal with the exception of Plngawan [@li1981;@li1985]. I have recorded /b/ pronounced as a voiced bilabial plosive [b] word-initially in some words in Skikun and C'uli' (see @sec:culi-consonants).

#### Skikun vowel inventory

Skikun Atayal has the same vowel inventory as Squliq and C'uli', including mid vowels and a quasi-phonemic schwa, shown in @tbl:skikun-vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Skikun Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:skikun-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
e     & (ə)    & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ are rarer than the vowels /a i u/. As in other Atayal dialects that have them, they mostly come from the monophthongization of historical diphthongs /ay/ and /aw/.

As in all Atayal dialects, schwa does not occur in the final (stressed) syllable, but can occur anywhere else. It's distribution is further discussed in the next section.

#### Skikun phonotactics {#sec:skikun-phonotactics}

The syllable types allowed in Skikun are very similar to those that are common to Squliq. They are presented in @tbl:skikun-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in Skikun Atayal {#tbl:skikun-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| CV            | qu.tux  | 'one'     |
| CGV           | qwa.lax | 'rain'    |
| CVC           | baq     | 'to know' |
| CGVC          | byaq    | 'worm'    |

Schwa is pervasive in Skikun, and follows every consonant that does not have a following cardinal vowel. As such, non-final closed syllables in Skikun are only allowed on morpheme boundaries, for example using the perfective infix *-in-*: *kinholan* 'place of origin, home village'.^[There is at least one content word in the native vocabulary that appears to violate this principle: *kinpahux* 'pit viper'. Skikun does have a verbal root *pahux* 'to snap, to break', so *kinpahux* in the meaning of 'pit viper' can be argued to be a derived form, albeit with no traceable semantic link.] Other affixes that can form a closed syllable include *cin-* (multiple meanings), *kin-* 'extremely', *min-* 'N times'.

<!-- TODO: mquti' vs quci' - palatalization may not be full or automatic. discuss ti > ci in any case -->

The only word-final open syllables in Skikun are those with the vowel /i/, where it undergoes compensatory lengthening: *bənaqiy* 'sand', *həlaqiy* 'snow'. Words that have a final long /u/ in Squliq will instead end in /x/ in Skikun, e.g. Squliq *sənyuw* vs Skikun *sənyux* 'rope'. This is due to different changes of historical \*g (see Section XXX).
<!-- TODO: add link to section -->

### Matu'aw

#### Matu'aw consonant inventory

Matu'aw is spoken in two tribal villages in Miaoli county, Tai'an township, Ta-hsing village (苗栗縣泰安鄉大興村). The consonant inventory of Matu'aw is characterized by the lack of both /c/ and /q/ phonemes, just like its neighbouring S'uli' dialect. It is shown in full in @tbl:matuaw-consonants.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'aw Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:matuaw-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p     & t        & k      &       & ' [ʔ] \\
b [β] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ng [ŋ] &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Unlike S'uli', Matu'aw /y/ does not have a [ʑ] allophone before the vowel /i/, and in this environment it is still pronounced as a palatal approximant [j] or more emphatically, a voiced palatal fricative [ʝ].

Matu'aw /t/ does not affricate before /i/, and is pronounced as [t] in all environments, e.g. *timuʔ* 'salt'.

The lateral /l/ can appear in word-final position in Matu'aw, for example in the words *kanayril* 'woman', *ʔitayal* '(Atayal) person'.

Word-final glottal stops are highly audible in Matu'aw, even after diphthongs in words like *wawʔ* 'pigeon', *kayʔ* 'language, speech', and *balayʔ* 'good'. These syllable types are also discussed further in @sec:matuaw-phonotactics.

#### Matu'aw vowel inventory {#sec:matuaw-vowels}

The vowel inventory of Matu'aw is a simple three vowel system, shown in @tbl:matuaw-vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'aw Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:matuaw-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
      &        &       \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Matu'aw does not have mid vowels, and preserves diphthongs instead. Schwa does not appear in the surface representation, and all instances of penultimate schwa in other dialects correspond to /a/ in Matu'aw, as shown in @tbl:matuaw-penult-schwa.

: Correspondences of penultimate schwa in Matu'aw {#tbl:matuaw-penult-schwa}

| Matu'aw | S'uli' | Squliq | Matu'uwal | Plngawan | Gloss     |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| kahuʔ   | kəhu   | kəhuʔ  | ʔakhul    | kuhuʔ    | 'granary' |
| salaʔ   | səla   | səlaq  | cəlaq     | calak    | 'paddy'   |

These correspondences will be explored in depth in Chapter 4.
<!-- TODO: add proper link -->

#### Matu'aw phonotactics {#sec:matuaw-phonotactics}

Matu'aw allows a relatively high number of syllable types, shown in @tbl:matuaw-syllable-types. The maximum syllable is CGVC or CVGC.

: Syllable types in Matu'aw Atayal {#tbl:matuaw-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example   | Gloss             |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| CV            | tu.la.ʔiy | 'eel'             |
| CVC           | yi.luk    | 'strawberry'      |
| CGV           | kwa.ra    | 'all'             |
| CGVC          | ʔwaw      | 'alcoholic drink' |
| CVGC          | wawʔ      | 'pigeon'          |

<!-- TODO: add saswayʔ as a CGVGC syllable -->
Syllables of the type CVGC are auditorily different from hiatuses in Matu'uwal. In Matu'uwal, the word 'needle' is pronounced [ra.ˈum], with two distinct syllable peaks and stress on the vowel /u/. On the other hand, the Matu'aw cognate [rawm] is pronounced as a single syllable with stress falling on the vowel /a/. Since stress in Atayal is invariably word-final, this allows us to analyze the Matu'aw word as monosyllabic, with the syllable type CVGC.

Matu'aw preserves vowel distinctions outside the final foot, like Matu'uwal and Plngawan. Some examples are shown in @tbl:matuaw-antepenult-vowels.

: Vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable in Matu'aw {#tbl:matuaw-antepenult-vowels}

| Matu'aw     | Gloss    |
|-------------|----------|
| h**a**puniʔ | 'fire'   |
| ʔ**i**tayal | 'person' |
| t**u**laʔiy | 'eel'    |

The third-to-last vowels may be somewhat unstable: my main language consultant would occasionally offer two or even three variants before settling on a vowel. There may be many factors at play, and I cannot judge whether this indicates the state of the language, interference from other dialects, or lack of practice with competent speakers. I have noticed a tendency among younger speakers to reduce prepenultimate vowels to /a/, although I have not conducted interviews to see how widespread this is. All of this being said, Matu'aw agrees with Matu'uwal on the third-to-last vowel in cognates, and by and large agrees with Plngawan as well. These correspondences are discussed in detail in Section XXX.
<!-- TODO: add section link -->

There is a tendency in Matu'aw to avoid non-final closed syllables (i.e. heterosyllabic consonant clusters). @tbl:matuaw-cluster-avoidance shows a few examples of closed syllables in Matu'uwal and Plngawan, and corresponding Matu'aw cognates. The vowel in these cases is always /a/.

: Tautomorphemic consonant cluster avoidance in Matu'aw {#tbl:matuaw-cluster-avoidance}

|-----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| yakalit   | akliʔ     | ɹaklit   | 'leopard'      |
| kabahaniʔ | kabahniq  | kabahniʔ | 'bird'         |
| ʔalating  | qalting   | ʔalting  | 'wooden plank' |

This tendency is less strict on morpheme boundaries, where closed syllables can and do occur: *tum-sa-saliʔ* 'to build a house' (< *saliʔ* 'house'), *kum-kagiy* 'to strip bark from hemp, to decorticate' (< *kagiy* 'hemp, ramie').

Li [-@li1981;@li1982b] recorded word-final /g/ in his fieldwork on the Matu'aw dialect in Matabalay village. In my fieldwork, I found no instances of word-final /g/, and the words that were expected to have it instead ended with an open syllable, as shown in @tbl:matuaw-final-g-comparison.

: Comparison of Paul Li's and my own Matu'aw data on final /g/ {#tbl:matuaw-final-g-comparison}

| Li's data (circa 1980) | My data (2020) | Gloss             |
|------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| siniyug                | sinyuw         | 'rope'            |
| tulaʔig                | tulaʔiy        | 'eel'             |

| ʔarag                  | ʔaraw          | 'ribs'            |

There is no reason to doubt the veracity of Li's data, as his expertise in linguistic fieldwork has been proved with decades of meticulous research on Formosan languages, Atayal chief among them. Moreover, comparative data from Seediq dialects [@li1981;@li1982b] does point to a historical \*g in these words. What happened here is that Li managed to record this sound when he was doing his fieldwork forty years ago, and it has since disappeared from Matu'aw. The most conservative speakers that I can interview in 2020 were young and innovative when Li was conducting his research.

In fact, Li [-@li1982, sec. 2.2.1] says as much when he mentiones that younger speakers in Matabalay village tended to replace the final /g/ with /w/ or /y/ depending on the vowel. A native speaker from Matabalay village who was 50 years old in 1980 had already completely lost final /g/, and only Li's 63 year old consultant (at the time of his fieldwork) still retained it.

Word-initial /x/ can be found in at least one word in Matu'aw: *xuyil* 'dog', compare Matu'uwal *xuwil*, but Squliq *huzil*, S'uli' *huzin*, Plngawan *huɹil*. Since even Matu'uwal only has two words with initial /x/, the other being *xuxuʔ* 'breasts', for which no Matu'aw cognate exists, this may be the only occurrence of word-initial /x/ in the dialect.

## Synchronic alternations {#sec:synchronic-alternations}

There are numerous synchronic phonological alternations in both consonants and vowels in Atayal dialects. Some of these are common to many dialects, while others are restricted to just one or two.

The sound alternations that are shared between various dialects can be either inherited from Proto-Atayal or be the result of linguistic drift, whereby a sound change occurs separately in different dialects. The two cases are relatively easy to distinguish with the comparative data at hand. Instances of both the inherited alternations and drift-induced alternations are given in this section. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but it includes the major alternations that can be found in various Atayal dialects.

### Consonant alternations {#sec:consonant-alternations}

#### Devoicing and lenition of final voiced obstruents {#sec:final-devoicing}

Discounting the quasi-phonemic /z/ in Squliq, which is almost entirely in complementary distribution with /y/, there are two voiced obstruent phonemes in all varieties of Atayal: /b/ and /g/. Only Matu'uwal allows them to occur in word-final position, and we will compare data from other dialects with Matu'uwal cognates.

I have not been able to find a single cognate set that demonstrates this for all seven dialects in this study, so I will use multiple correspondence sets instead. The devoicing of /b/ in Squliq and Skikun is shown in @tbl:b-devoi-sq-sk.

: Alternations of final /b/ in Squliq and Skikun {#tbl:b-devoi-sq-sk}

| Matu'uwal | Squliq  | Skikun  | Gloss                    |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------------------------|
| humgub    | həməgup | həməgup | 'to perform a rite (AV)' |
| hagban    | həbəgan | həgupan | 'to perform a rite (PV)' |
| humab     | həmap   | həmap   | 'to stab (AV)'           |
| habun     | habaw   | habun   | 'to stab (PV)'           |

Several things of note are happening in this table. There are vowel alternations in both Matu'uwal and Squliq, which are discussed in detail in @sec:historical-schwa-alternations. The Squliq PV form *həbəgan* also undergoes sporadic metathesis of the consonants /b/ and /g/ (we would expect \*\*həgəban here instead). Squliq *habaw* is the irrealis PV form, with the suffix *-aw*. And lastly, Skikun does not exhibit consonant or vowel alternation in *həməgup~həgupan* 'to perform a rite', and instead regularizes the verb. This sort of paradigm leveling is common in Skikun, see @sec:paradigm-leveling for more examples. Nevertheless, some verbs do still retain consonant alternations, as shown in the pair *həmap~habun* 'to stab'.

Li [-@li1981, p. 251;-@li1982b, pp. 174-175] finds only five cognates shared between various Atayal dialects including Matu'uwal, plus another two items which do not have a Matu'uwal cognate, but have an alternating /b/ appearing in suffixed forms. I have not found any data other than what Li has, although some of my data is slightly different, possibly due to dialectal variation or language change. The five cognates with historical final \*b are shown in @tbl:final-b-devoicing.

| masuwag   | məsuyap | məsuyak | masuɹak  | pəsuyak   | 'to yawn'          |

Li [-@li1982b, p. 174] has Plngawan *humuk~huban* 'to perform rites' (his gloss is 'to do magic'), but I have only been able to elicit *mpahuk~sipahuk* 'to scry, to divine'.^[Note the lack of a vowel after the first consonant in *mpahuk*. This is my transcription of what appears to be a syllabic nasal used as a derivational prefix, see @sec:plngawan-phonotactics for more.] The Plngawan verb form 'to perform rites/magic' is *murahuʔ~parahon*, according to my fieldwork. Nevertheless, *mpahuk* from my data is still a cognate, just with different affixation.

Matu'aw also has /b/ devoice to /p/ in word-final position, e.g. *gumawp* 'to share a cup (AV)' vs the suffixed form *gawbaw* 'to share a cup (PV.SBJV)'.

The Plngawan and C'uli', the phoneme alternating with /b/ is not /p/, but rather /k/. Note that the same happens for only a single item in Skikun (in my data). This is due to another sound change whereby labials merge into velars into final position, discussed further in @sec:merger-labial-velar.

Matu'uwal *masuwag* 'to yawn' has final /g/ instead of the expected /b/. Li [-@li1981, p. 252] notes that he did record the alternative pronunciation *masuwab* from some speakers, and also gives the locative voice form *syaban* in Squliq [@li1980, p. 358], so the change to /g/ in Matu'uwal must have been a later innovation.
<!-- 2. C'uli' *pəcəhut* may or may not be a cognate: it means 'to squeeze, to tighten' instead of 'to suck', for which the word *sibi* is used. -->
<!-- b > p not f -->

Unlike /b/, the phoneme /g/ is not devoiced in most dialects, with the exception of Skikun. Instead, it is lenited to the semivowel /w/, as seen in @tbl:final-g-lenition.

: Final /g/ lenition in various Atayal dialects {#tbl:final-g-lenition}

| lumpug    | ləməpuw | ləməpux | lumpuw   | ləməpu  | 'to count (AV)'    |
| lapgun    | ləpəgun | ləpəgun | lapgan   | ləpəgun | 'to count (PV/LV)' |

Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that still preserves /g/ in word-final position after the vowels /a/ and /u/ (it does not appear after /i/). Skikun preserves its fricative features, but devoices it word-finally. In all other dialects, it becomes /w/, which is most apparent after the low vowel /a/. When preceded by /u/, it is realized as vowel lengthening, but is typically written as \<uw\>.

When these verbs are suffixed, for example with the PV suffix *-un* or the LV suffix *-an*, the underlying /g/ phoneme surfaces. Note that I have *səmaxan* for Skikun 'to make the bed (LV)', this is likely due to an ongoing merger between the phonemes /x/ and /g/ in the dialect (see @sec:skikun-consonants).

Li [-@li1981;@li1982b] reported final /g/ in Matu'aw wherever Matu'uwal had it, and also where it did not, namely after the vowel /i/. However, I did not find any examples of final /g/ during my fieldwork on Matu'aw, and it was instead reflected as /w/ after the vowel /a/ and as vowel length after high vowels, see also @sec:matuaw-phonotactics.

There are no examples of root-final /g/ alternations before the vowel /i/.

#### Final labial to velar merger {#sec:merger-labial-velar}

Plngawan and C'uli' disallow final labials completely. If a verbal root has an underlying labial in final position, it will become a velar instead, and the labial only emerges in suffixed forms. @tbl:merger-labial-velar demonstrates the correspondence of final labials in other Atayal dialects to final velars in Plngawan and C'uli'.

: Word-final labial to velar change in Plngawan and C'uli' {#tbl:merger-labial-velar}

| Plngawan | C'uli'  | Matu'uwal | Squliq  | Skikun  | Gloss              |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|---------|--------------------|
| maloɹak  | məluyak | qumaluwap | qəmalup | qəmalup | 'to hunt'          |
| panek    | pənek   | panaip    | pənep   | pənyep  | 'to fish'          |
| yumuk    | yəmuk   | ʔumiyup   | məyup   | miyup   | 'to blow'          |
| magagok  | məgəgok | gumaub    | məgop   | məgop   | 'to share a cup'   |
| (mpahuk) | məhəguk | humgub    | həməgup | həməgup | 'to perform rites' |
| rong     | rong    | raum      | rom     | rom     | 'needle'           |
| ɹuhung   | yuhung  | ʔuhum     | yuhum   | yuhum   | 'gallbladder'      |
| cumong   | cəmong  | cumaum    | səmom   | cəmom   | 'to wipe'          |

S'uli' and Matu'aw also allows final labials to occur, e.g. S'uli' *ʔəmlyap*, Matu'aw *malyap* 'to hunt'; S'uli' *pənep*, Matu'aw *panayp* 'to fish'; S'uli' *yəmup*, Matu'aw *ʔumyup* 'to blow'; S'uli' *rom*, Matu'aw *rawm* 'needle'; S'uli' and Matu'aw *yuhum* 'gallbladder'. My Skikun data has final labials in most words where other dialects have them, though in some words they become velars, for example *məsuyak* 'to yawn', cf. Squliq and S'uli' *məsuyap*. This was noted by Li [-@li1980, pp. 379-381] in his studies, when he recorded various degrees of neutralization of final labials in Skikun, depending on the speaker. Younger speakers tended to neutralize the labials in more words, and this is also true for other ongoing sound changes. In my data, this only happens in a very limited amount of lexical items.

Plngawan and C'uli' thus have consonant alternations between labials and velars, as shown in @tbl:pl-cu-labial-velar-altns.

: Labial to velar alternations in Plngawan and C'uli' {#tbl:pl-cu-labial-velar-altns}

| Plngawan | C'uli'  | Gloss          |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| yumuk    | yəmuk   | 'to blow (AV)' |
| yupan    | yupan   | 'to blow (LV)' |
| cumong   | cəmong  | 'to wipe (AV)' |
| coman    | coman   | 'to wipe (LV)' |

The labials /p/ and /m/ surface when the verb is suffixed, but not when the segment is word-final. There are exceptions as well, for example the Plngawan verbs *maloɹak* 'to hunt (AV)' and *panek* 'to fish (AV)' do not have this alternation in my data, and retain the velar when suffixed. This is discussed in @sec:paradigm-leveling.

#### Alternation between /c/ and /t/ {#sec:merger-final-c-t}

This merger concerns alternations in verbal roots, namely suffixed and unsuffixed forms. There exists a different phenomenon in Atayal, where the phoneme /t/ is affricated into [ts] in word-final position for some speakers. This occurs in various dialects [@li1982, sec. 2.4.1;@chen2011, p. 25;@chen2012, p. 14;@huang2016a, p. 12], but in this case there is no phonemic distinction, and the effect is purely phonetic.

@tbl:c-t-alternation-contrast demonstrates the contrast between alternating and non-alternating verbs in five Atayal dialects, using cognate forms. The infixed forms have identical final consonants, but the suffixed forms have separate phonemes preceding the suffix in Matu'uwal and Plngawan, though there is no distinction in C'uli', Squliq, or Skikun.

: Contrast between alternating and non-alternating forms in several Atayal dialects {#tbl:c-t-alternation-contrast}

| Matu'uwal | Plngawan | C'uli' | Squliq | Skikun | Gloss          |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| kumat     | kumat    | kəmat  | kəmat  | kəmat  | 'to bite (AV)' |
| kacun     | kacun    | katun  | katun  | katun  | 'to bite (PV)' |
| kumut     | kumut    | kəmut  | kəmut  | kəmut  | 'to cut (AV)'  |
| kutan     | kutan    | kutan  | kutan  | kutan  | 'to cut (LV)'  |

Both S'uli' and Matu'aw have this alternation as well, though in these two dialects, /t/ alternates with /s/ due to a merger between \*c and \*s. For example, Matu'aw *yumingat\~yingasun* : Matu'uwal *ʔumingat\~ʔingacun* : Skikun *mingat\~ngatun* 'to rob'. S'uli' has *ʔəlisan* 'to peel (LV)', cf. Plngawan *ʔumalit\~ʔalicun*, C'uli' *milit\~litun*.

The regularity of these alternations between Matu'uwal, Plngawan, S'uli', and Matu'aw, as well as a complete lack of any conditioning environment, mean that these alternations were inherited from a common ancestor rather than innovated separately. On the other hand, C'uli', Squliq, and Skikun must have regularized these alternating verbs into non-alternating forms, thus losing the contrast. For more on the regularization processes in Atayal, see @sec:paradigm-leveling.

#### Alternation between /l/ and /n/ {#sec:merger-final-l-n}

The merger of final /l/ and /n/ is, on the one hand, characteristic of certain dialects, but on the other hand commonly found in the speech of younger speakers all across the Atayal community.

It is characteristic of some S'uli' and C'uli' dialects, as demonstrated in @tbl:suli-culi-final-l-n-merger. Matu'uwal, Plngawan, and Matu'aw all preserve the phonemic distinction between /l/ and /n/ in word-final position, but it is neutralized in my S'uli' and C'uli' data.

: Final /l/ and /n/ merger in S'uli' and C'uli' {#tbl:suli-culi-final-l-n-merger}

| S'uli'  | C'uli'  | Matu'uwal | Plngawan | Matu'aw | Gloss     |

| tayan   | tayan   | ʔitaal    | ʔitaɹal  | ʔitayal | 'Atayal'  |
| yupun   | yupun   | ʔawpun    | (ʔaraʔ)  | yayupun | 'pants'   |
| ləhəbun | ləhəbun | lalihbun  | lahbun   | lahabun | 'stomach' |

There appear to be C'uli' dialects that still allow word-final /l/. @li1998 provides a wordlist, where some lexical items from the Ryuhing (金岳) and Knngyan (金洋) villages have final /l/, although neither dataset is fully consistent, meaning that the change was already underway when Li was collecting his data.

Speakers of other dialects may exhibit this merger as well. It is pervasive in the speech of younger Atayal in many different villages [@li1982, sec. 2.3]. For any given speaker, the merger may be total, or manifest itself in only part of the vocabulary [@rau2000].

For those dialects or speakers with the final /l/ to /n/ merger, verbal roots will show alternations like those in @tbl:l-n-alternations.

: /l\~n/ alternations in S'uli' and C'uli' {#tbl:l-n-alternations}

| S'uli'  | C'uli'  | Gloss              |

| galun   | galun   | 'to take (PV)'     |
| səməbin | səməbin | 'to leave (AV)'    |
| səbilan | səbilun | 'to leave (PV/LV)' |

The underlying representation of verbal roots can thus be determined by examining suffixed forms. I have not yet come across cases of regularization of this particular alternation, perhaps because it is still relatively new. Despite the short timeframe, it has managed to spread throughout the Atayal-speaking territory.

#### Other alternations {#sec:other-consonant-alternations}

<!-- TODO: add alternations of Plngawan ɹ (where it gets deleted) -->
There are other, less common consonantal alternations that can be found in one or more dialects. Two of these are of particular interest in this dissertation, and are discussed below.

Some verbs that have a final /s/ in the root that appears only in suffixed forms. @li1980 identified several such verbs, which are listed in @tbl:root-final-s-alternations (entries marked with an asterisk are taken from Li's paper, the rest are from my own field notes).

| rahisan    |          | hiran      | rarahisan    | rəhisan\*   | 'to dry in the air (LV)' |
| magiyay    | magiy    | məgyay     |              | məgyas      | 'to run away (AV)'       |
|            | pageran  | pəgyaran   |              | pəgyasan    | 'to run away (LV)'       |

In Plngawan and Squliq the alternating consonant is /r/ instead. This is due to a rhotacism rule in both these dialects, where /s/ changes to /r/ in some environments, see Section XXX for more details. Note that Skikun has final /s/ in AV forms of all four verbs. This is due to paradigm leveling in the dialect, which happens with many other alternations as well, see @sec:paradigm-leveling for more information.
<!-- TODO: add section link -->

The Matu'aw verbs originally had final /g/ in the AV forms of the three verbs in the table, as recorded by Li [-@li1980, p. 385]. He gives *mabazig* 'to buy (AV)', *rumahig* 'to dry in the air (AV)', and *kumakagig* 'to strip hemp (AV)'.

However, not all verbs with a final long /iː/ have this alternation: cf. Matu'uwal *mahiy\~bahiyun*, Plngawan *mahiy\~bahyan*, Squliq *mihiy\~bəhyun*, C'uli' *mahiy\~bəhyun* 'to hit, to beat'. It is thus root-specific, and limited to only a few words.

Another even more specific alternation is a final glottal stop /ʔ/ alternating with /l/ in suffixed forms. There are very few words with this alternation, shown in @tbl:gs-l-alternation. The forms marked with asterisks are taken from Shih [-@shih2008, p. 16], Chen [-@chen2012, p. 137], and Egerod [-@egerod1965, p. 262], the rest come from my own field notes.

: Alternation of /ʔ/ and /l/ in Atayal dialects {#tbl:gs-l-alternation}

|           | halan\*   |          |          | halan  | 'to go (LV)' |

I found the Plngawan verb *mahaʔ\~halan* in Shih's and Chen's theses. It is unclear how it differs from *musaʔ*, since both are glossed as 'to go'. When conducting fieldwork on C'uli', I elicited the forms *salan* and *halan* for 'to go (LV)', with apparently the same meaning, but I did not come across the AV form of *halan*.

Note that unlike other dialects, the Squliq forms *ʔəsan* 'to go (LV)' and *swaʔun* 'how (PV)' are regular, without an alternating /l/. This is a later innovation in Squliq, which regularized many of its irregular verbs. See @sec:paradigm-leveling for more information on this regularization phenomenon.

The Matu'uwal word *humicuwaʔ* 'how' and its cognates in other dialects are special, because it is a wh-word but it is also marked for Austronesian voice morphology, which occurs only in verbs. It serves as the main predicate in sentences where it appears, but non-AV forms are rare. I have elicited a PV form in Matu'uwal (*həcuwalun*) and found a PV form for Plngawan (*hacolun*) in @shih2008 and @chen2012. Both the Matu'uwal and Plngawan suffixed forms have an alternating /l/ phoneme, and I expect other dialects to have the same behaviour in cognates.

### Vowel alternations

#### Prepenultimate vowel weakening {#sec:prepen-vowel-weakening}

One of the most common phonological phenomena in Atayal dialects is vowel weakening outside the rightmost foot. In dialects with this type of vowel weakening, only the last two syllables of a word may have phonemic vowel distinctions, and all preceding syllables may only have a reduced vowel (usually a schwa but sometimes /a/, depending on the dialect and the speaker). This phenomenon can be readily observed through verbal roots that can attach suffixes (such as PV *-un* or LV *-an*), and is demonstrated in @tbl:prepen-vowel-weakening.

: Prepenultimate vowel weakening in various Atayal dialects {#tbl:prepen-vowel-weakening}

| Dialect | Bare stem | Suffixed form | Gloss       |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Squliq  | qalup     | qəlup-un      | 'to hunt'   |
| Skikun  | hakut     | həkut-un      | 'to move'   |
| S'uli'  | ʔasuw     | ʔəsug-un      | 'to divide' |
| C'uli'  | piray     | pəray-un      | 'to turn'   |

Prepenultimate vowel weakening occurs in the four dialects in @tbl:prepen-vowel-weakening, namely Squliq, Skikun, S'uli', and C'uli'. It affects nouns as well, but there are no suffixes that attach to nouns (unless the same root can also serve as a verb), so the vowel weakening process can only be seen in the distribution of vowels in nouns. Egerod [-@egerod1965, pp. 255-257] and Li [@li1980, pp. 369-371] describe this alternation for Squliq, but it works the same in the other three dialects.

There are some exceptions to this rule. Some loanwords and a few native words still preserve cardinal vowels outside the final two syllables. Several examples are given in @tbl:vowel-weakening-exceptions.

: Exceptions to the vowel weakening rule {#tbl:vowel-weakening-exceptions}

| Dialect | Word    | Gloss                    |
|---------|---------|--------------------------|
| Squliq  | betunux | 'beautiful'              |
| Skikun  | qarapiʔ | 'black drongo (bird sp.) |
| S'uli'  | cicini  | 'stag beetle'            |
| C'uli'  | icikong | 'click beetle'           |

All the words in the table appear to be native (I am reasonably certain they did not originate in Sinitic languages or Japanese), but all have a cardinal vowel in the third-to-last syllable. However, such words are quite rare.

Recent loanwords tend to preserve vowels outside the head foot as well, for example C'uli' *petangko* 'light-vented bulbul (bird sp.)', likely from Southern Min 白頭鵠仔 *pe̍h-thâu-khok-á*, and *sirasagi* 'egret', from Japanese 白鷺 *shirasagi*.

Lastly, some derivational affixes like the perfective infix *-in-* are not subject to vowel weakening in the dialects where they occur, for example S'uli' *rinmuʔiy* 'roof' (cf. *sərəmuʔiy* 'to construct a roof (IV)'), Squliq *pinqəzywan* 'story' (cf. *pəqəzyuʔ* 'to tell'), Skikun *minəbes* 'to have bought' (cf. *mes* 'to buy (AV)').

Note that the AV infix *-əm-* and the AV prefix *mə-* in Squliq, Skikun, S'uli, and C'uli' are **not** instances of the vowel reduction rule applying to an underlying form with a cardinal vowel. We can see this by looking at monosyllabic roots with this infix, where prepenultimate weakening does not apply. In such forms, the infix still has a schwa vowel: e.g. *kəmat* 'to bite (AV)' or *kəmut* 'to cut (AV)', identical in all four dialects.

#### Alternations of historical schwa {#sec:historical-schwa-alternations}

Another type of alternations, common to all dialects of Atayal, are the alternations of a historical schwa vowel in verbal roots. As mentioned in @sec:phoneme-inventories-phonotactics, no Atayal dialect allows the vowel schwa to appear in the final (stressed) syllable, if it is allowed to occur in the dialect at all. This alternation was first noted and descibed for Squliq by Egerod [-@egerod1965, pp. 257-258], but it works very similarly in all Atayal dialects due to its origins in the protolanguage (see Section XXX).
<!-- TODO: add section link -->

If this alternating vowel occurs in the final syllable of the root, it surfaces as /u/ when the root is not suffixed, such as in bare stem forms, or infixed forms. If it is followed by a suffix, the vowel is lenited. This process can be seen in @tbl:root-final-schwa-alternations.

: Alternations of historical schwa in root-final syllables {#tbl:root-final-schwa-alternations}

| Dialect   | AV form      | Suffixed form | Gloss           |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Squliq    | s\<əm\>əʔung | səʔəng-un     | 'to cut bamboo' |
| Skikun    | q\<əm\>ipul  | qəpəl-un      | 'to tread'      |
| S'uli'    | məhut        | pəhət-an      | 'to press'      |
| C'uli'    | məpux        | pəx-an        | 'to push down'  |
| Matu'uwal | t\<um\>aluk  | talk-un       | 'to cook'       |
| Plngawan  | k\<un\>luh   | kilh-un       | 'to reap'       |
| Matu'aw   | k\<um\>ikuʔ  | kakaʔ-un      | 'to pinch'      |

In Squliq, Skikun, S'uli', and C'uli', the vowel /u/ alternates with /ə/ in suffixed forms.  In Matu'aw, it alternates with /a/ instead (Matu'aw completely disallows the vowel [ə], see @sec:matuaw-vowels). In Matu'uwal and Plngawan, the vowel is more commonly deleted after suffixation.

These roots with an alternating vowel contrast with roots that have non-alternating /u/ phoneme in the final syllable. Examples of such roots are given in @tbl:non-alternating-final-u.

: Non-alternating stems with /u/ in the final syllable {#tbl:non-alternating-final-u}

| Dialect   | AV form     | Suffixed form | Gloss           |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Squliq    | maqut       | pəqut-an      | 'to ask'        |
| Skikun    | t\<əm\>ubux | təbux-un      | 'to sow'        |
| S'uli'    | kəsyus      | kəsyus-an     | 'to stir-fry'   |
| C'uli'    | pəhapuy     | puy-un        | 'to cook grain' |
| Matu'uwal | t\<um\>akuʔ | takuʔ-un      | 'to scoop up'   |
| Plngawan  | t\<um\>abul | tabul-un      | 'to till'       |
| Matu'aw   | s\<um\>yuk  | syuk-un       | 'to answer'     |

There is a clear difference between the verbs in @tbl:root-final-schwa-alternations and the verbs in @tbl:non-alternating-final-u with regard to the vowel /u/ in the final syllable of the root. In @tbl:root-final-schwa-alternations, this vowel comes from an original \*ə, which was later changed to /u/ only in the final syllable. We can corroborate this with evidence from Proto-Austronesian reconstructions, cf. PAN \*taNək and Matu'uwal *taluk* 'to cook'. The PV suffix *-un* in Atayal itself comes from PAN \*-ən.

#### Vowel coalescence {#sec:vowel-coalescence}

This alternation phenomenon occurs in almost all Atayal dialects, with the exception of Matu'uwal. Its effect is the change of two separate vowel segments into a single vowel, and it is induced by suffixation. @egerod1965 has some Squliq data with these changes, but it is rather haphazard; Li [-@li1980, pp. 372-373] provides many examples for Squliq, divided by category; Chen [-@chen2012, pp. 116-126] talks about vowel coalescence in Plngawan. @tbl:vowel-coalescence-dialects demonstrates this phenomenon with the PV suffix *-un* and the LV suffix *-an*.

: Vowel coalescence in various Atayal dialects {#tbl:vowel-coalescence-dialects}

| Dialect  | Base    | Suffix | Suffixed form | Gloss                 |
|----------|---------|--------|---------------|-----------------------|

| Matu'aw  | patuguʔ | -un    | patugun       | 'to invite'           |
| C'uli'   | pənahu  | -un    | pənəhun       | 'to start a fire'     |
| C'uli'   | naga    | -un    | nəgon         | 'to wait'             |
| Plngawan | tuʔ     | -un    | tun           | 'to send (on errand)' |
| Plngawan | rangaʔ  | -un    | rangon        | 'to raise'            |
| Plngawan | pamuhiʔ | -an    | pamuhen       | 'to plant'            |
| Plngawan | cabuʔ   | -an    | cabon         | 'to wrap'             |

The environment for vowel coalescence is a root ending in a glottal stop^[or a vowel in the case of S'uli' and C'uli', which here are analyzed as not having word-final phonemic glottal stops, see [@sec:suli-phonotactics;@sec:culi-phonotactics].], and a vowel-initial suffix, such as *-un* or *-an*. If the two vowels are identical, they merge into one vowel. If the final vowel of the root is /a/ and it is followed by the suffix *-un*, then the vowels coalesce into a mid vowel /o/. The glottal stop is lost in the suffixed form, thus Squliq /kitaʔ/ + /-an/ > /kətan/.

Note that in Squliq, Skikun, S'uli', and C'uli', the penultimate vowel in the suffixed forms in @tbl:vowel-coalescence-dialects is always weakened, even though the syllable is in the rightmost foot. In synchronic phonological terms, this is an instance of **overapplication opacity**. From the point of view of diachronic phonology, we would say that prepenultimate vowel weakening in these forms applied before vowel coalescence.

I do not have any Matu'aw data for coalescence of a low and a high vowel into a mid vowel, i.e. /-aʔ/ + /-un/ > /-on/. This may be due to the paucity of data in my own field notes, or due to Matu'aw disallowing it. More data is needed to understand the limits of vowel coalescence in Matu'aw.

Plngawan has additional environments for vowel coalescence: a high vowel /i/ or /u/ in the final syllable of the root, followed by a glottal stop, and a suffix beginning with /a/, such as *-an*. These coalesce into the mid vowel /e/ or /o/, depending on the frontness of the high vowel in the root. We therefore have /cabuʔ/ + /-an/ > /cabon/. This word is distinguished from *cabun* (< /cabuʔ/ + /-un/). Other dialects do not have vowel coalescence in this environment, but instead change the high vowel into a homorganic glide after deleting the glottal stop, as shown in @tbl:gliding-high-vowels-before-an.

: Gliding of high vowels before *-an* in Atayal dialects {#tbl:gliding-high-vowels-before-an}

| Dialect | Base   | Suffixed form | Gloss        |
|---------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Matu'aw | ʔaluʔ  | ʔalwan        | 'to close'   |
| S'uli'  | ʔəluʔ  | ʔəlwan        | 'to close'   |
| Matu'aw | pawgiʔ | pugyan        | 'to sun-dry' |
| S'uli'  | pawgi  | pəgyan        | 'to sun-dry' |
| Skikun  | pugiʔ  | pəgyan        | 'to sun-dry' |
| C'uli'  | pogiʔ  | pəgyan        | 'to sun-dry' |

Neither gliding nor vowel coalescence apply in Matu'uwal, which instead preserves the root-final glottal stops, e.g. /pawgiʔ/ + /-an/ > /pugiʔan/ 'to sun-dry'.^[The vowel change in the root is a different phenomenon, discussed in @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng.]

In some cases, vowel coalescence in Plngawan, S'uli', and C'uli' is **underapplied**, and both vowels along with the glottal stop are preserved. The glottal stop in these words originates from a historical \*q, which can be seen in cognates in other dialects, such as Squliq. @tbl:underapplication-coalescence-historical-q shows several such examples.

: Underapplication of vowel coalescence in roots with historical \*q {#tbl:underapplication-coalescence-historical-q}

| metaʔ    | (?)     | meta     | metaq    | 'to stab (AV)'  |
| bitaʔan  | bətaʔan | taʔan    | betaqan  | 'to stab (LV)'  |
| baʔ      | ba      | ba       | baq      | 'to know (AV)'  |
| baʔun    | baʔun   | baʔun    | baqun    | 'to know (PV)'  |

| paseʔan  |         | pəsyaʔan | pəsyaqan | 'to laugh (LV)' |

From a diachronical perspective, this means that vowel coalescence preceded the loss of \*q in these dialects. This is further discussed in Section XXX.

#### Hiatus resolution in Matu'uwal {#sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution}

Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that distinguishes hiatuses, or vowel clusters, from two vowels with an intervening glottal stop. However, there is a restriction on hiatuses: they may only occur in the final foot of a word. If a root with a hiatus is suffixed, the hiatus is no longer inside the final foot, and thus must be resolved.

There are two kinds of hiatuses in Matu'uwal: (1) two identical vowels, and (2) a low vowel /a/ followed by a high vowel, called *closing hiatuses* from here on. The reason I do not consider other combinations to be hiatuses is because they do not show this alternating behaviour: the phonetically audible glides between those vowels must therefore be phonemic, so that hiatus resolution does not apply in those cases.

The two kinds of hiatuses are resolved differently in Matu'uwal. If a root with an identical vowel hiatus is suffixed, the hiatus becomes a single vowel, as demonstrated in @tbl:ml-identical-hiatus-resolution.

: Resolution of identical vowel hiatuses in Matu'uwal {#tbl:ml-identical-hiatus-resolution}

| AV         | PV/LV  | Gloss              |
|------------|--------|--------------------|
| k\<um\>aal | kal-an | 'to speak'         |
| r\<um\>uuʔ | ruʔ-un | 'to cling to s.o.' |
| h\<um\>iiʔ | hiʔ-an | 'to pour'          |

The precise phonological nature of this change (deletion, coalescence) is up for debate. The end result in all three cases in @tbl:ml-identical-hiatus-resolution is CVCVC structure, i.e. identical vowel hiatus resolution results in an open penultimate syllable.

Closing hiatuses are resolved differently. Instead of deletion or coalescence, the high vowel is simply glided, thus becoming a consonantal coda. This process can be seen in @tbl:ml-closing-hiatus-resolution.

: Resolution of closing hiatuses in Matu'uwal {#tbl:ml-closing-hiatus-resolution}

| AV         | PV/LV   | Gloss     |

| maiq       | bayq-an | 'to give' |
| c\<um\>aum | cawm-an | 'to wipe' |
| k\<um\>aiʔ | kayʔ-an | 'to dig'  |

The end result of resolving a closing hiatus is CVGCVC structure, where the penult is a closed syllable with a glide coda.

The commonality between these two kinds of hiatus resolution is the reduction in the number of syllables and resyllabification. Thus, by adding a monosyllabic suffix to a disyllabic base, we still get a disyllabic word after hiatus resolution applies. This can be seen in @tbl:resyllab-hiatus-resolution-ml.

|---------|---------------|------------|
| /ka.al/ | /ka.lan/      | 'to speak' |
| /ka.iʔ/ | /kay.ʔan/     | 'to dig'   |

The hiatus resolution rule can also interact with rhythmic vowel reduction (discussed in @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng), however these interactions are quite complex and outside the scope of this study. They should be looked upon in more detail in future research.

#### Vowel reduction in Matu'uwal and Plngawan {#sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng}

Matu'uwal, Plngawan, and Matu'aw are the only dialects that do not exhibit prepenultimate vowel reduction (discussed in @sec:prepen-vowel-weakening). However, Matu'uwal and Plngawan (and perhaps Matu'aw as well) still have vowel reduction processes operating on vowels outside the head foot, but they are not as total as in Squliq or C'uli'.

These vowel reduction processes have not received very much attention from researchers. Nevertheless, Chen [-@chen2012, pp. 87-115] has explored affixation-related vowel reduction in Plngawan using an Optimality theoretic approach, and @huang2017a looked at the patterns in Matu'uwal. The patterns themselves are presented in @tbl:vowel-reduction-ml-pl, with cognates for ease of comparison.

| s\<um\>irmaʔ     | s\<un\>ramaʔ  | 'to prepare (AV)'           |

The vowel reduction patterns are obviously quite different. For one, Matu'uwal reduces some vowels to a schwa, which does not happen in Plngawan. Secondly, reduction does not occur evenly in both dialects: some forms are reduced only in one dialect, but not the other. There are also similarities: vowel reduction can affect roots and prefixes in both dialects, though infixes remain unaffected.

The rules of vowel reduction in Matu'uwal and Plngawan operate on completely different principles. Reduction in Matu'uwal is **rhythmic**, meaning that it is conditioned metrically, and operates on the fourth-to-last vowel [@huang2017a]. The metrical quality of Matu'uwal vowel reduction can be seen in @tbl:rhythmic-vowel-weakening-ml, with prefixed/infixed data in the AV column, and suffixed data in the PV/LV column.

: Rhythmic vowel weakening in Matu'uwal {#tbl:rhythmic-vowel-weakening-ml}

| AV               | PV/LV           | Gloss               |

| s\<um\>anminuqil | sanamnuqil-un   | 'to kill'           |
| məka-gaung       | pak-gawng-un    | 'to go along river' |
| mas-kakaruʔ      | pəsi-kakaruʔ-an | 'to talk, to chat'  |
| mas-tatail       | pəsi-tatayl-an  | 'to jump'           |

Since reduction operates on the fourth-to-last vowel and does not affect infixed, it requires a long enough stem to demonstrate. The first three rows show reduction in 3-, 4-, and 5-syllable stems. In AV forms of 3-syllable stems (e.g. *humicuwaʔ*), the fourth-to-last vowel is in the infix, and so the reduction does not apply. By adding a monosyllabic suffix to the root (*həcuwalun*, note the alternating consonant), the fourth-to-last vowel is now in the root, and is reduced. However, since it is in the leftmost syllable, there is no way to resyllabify this word, and the vowel is left as a surface schwa.

In longer stems (or with longer prefixes), the weakened vowel will no longer be in the leftmost syllable, and will be therefore completely deleted, with resyllabification taking place. Here I analyze the stem of 'to be able' as *ʔanahuway*, assuming that underlyingly all the vowels are present in the stem. This stem is long enough to undergo reduction in both prefixed and suffixed forms, but the vowel that is weakened is different in the two cases. After weakening, the word is resyllabified, and the final result contains a non-final closed syllable.

The rhythmic reduction rule even applies to prefixes, as can be seen in the final three rows in @tbl:rhythmic-vowel-weakening-ml. The derivational prefixes *paka-* (AV *maka-*) and *pasi-* (AV *masi-*) are reduced diffently depending on how many syllables they are preceded by. Thus, in the form *məka-gaung* /mə.ka.ga.uŋ/ 'to go along river (AV)' the first vowel of the prefix is reduced, as it is the fourth-to-last vowel of the word. If the stem is suffixed, it becomes *pak-gawng-un* /pak.gaw.ŋun/ 'to go along river (PV)', with the second vowel in the prefix reduced, because it was fourth-to-last in the underlying representation. Note that this root also has a hiatus, which is resolved by gliding in the suffixed form (see @sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution). The gliding must occur before vowel reduction in order to be applied properly. This is an instance of **counterbleeding opacity**, meaning that the proper environment for vowel reduction cannot be deduced from only the surface form, due to hiatus resolution applying first.^[Here I use a rule-based phonological explanation, since opacity is notoriously difficult to deal with in constraint-based approaches, such as Optimality theory.]

The final two examples, *mas-kakaruʔ\~pəsi-kakaruʔ-an* 'to talk, to chat' and *mas-tatail\~pəsi-tatayl-an* 'to jump' have 3-syllable stems, but the initial syllable is Ca-reduplication on the root. Rhythmic vowel reduction does not normally apply in reduplicated forms, which is why the fourth-to-last vowel is still present in *pəsi-kakaruʔ-an* and *pəsi-tatayl-an* (another reason may be anti-gemination). Nevertheless, we see reduction of the sixth-to-last vowel in both forms, which confirms that the weakening rule indeed applies metrically in an iambic pattern, just like predicted by @huang2017a.

Unlike Matu'uwal, the vowel reduction pattern in Plngawan does not appear to be rhythmic. Chen [-@chen2012, pp. 87-115] only looked at a small subset of forms with vowel reduction in Plngawan, namely those with *-in-* infixation. Her analysis was thus very specific to this particular infix, in that the vowel after it gets deleted. In actuality, Plngawan allows vowel reduction to occur in other environments as well, some of which are shown in @tbl:plngawan-vowel-syncope.

: Vowel syncope in Plngawan {#tbl:plngawan-vowel-syncope}

| Plngawan      | Gloss                       |

| mas-taɹil     | 'to jump (AV)'              |
| pas-taɹil-an  | 'to jump (PV)'              |

The big difference between Plngawan vowel syncope and Matu'uwal vowel weakening is that the former does not depend on metricality, or at least not right-to-left metricality. The metrical structure of a stem does not change after adding a suffix: compare Plngawan *mas-taɹil\~pas-taɹil-an* and Matu'uwal *mas-tatail\~pəsi-tatayl-an* 'to jump'.

Instead, it is always the leftmost syllable in Plngawan that becomes closed after vowel syncope is applied, no matter how many syllables are to its right. This contrast is demonstrated with the pair *mu-hlaʔiy* /muh.la.ʔiː/ 'winter' and *mas-hulaʔiy* /mas.hu.la.ʔiː/ 'to snow', both of which are derived from *hulaʔiy* 'snow'. It is thus always the second vowel from the left edge that gets deleted where this rule applies. However, since unlike Matu'uwal vowel weakening, Plngawan vowel syncope does not lead to alternations with disyllabic prefixes, it could be argued that, synchronically speaking, the rule does not apply in cases like *mas-hulaʔiy* at all, and that the underlying form of the prefix is simply *mas-*/*pas-*. Nevertheless, there is still a common pattern with roots that do alternate, like *muhlaʔiy* 'winter' (< *hulaʔiy* 'snow') or *pahngaleʔan* 'to carry on shoulder (LV)' (< *hangaliʔ* 'shoulder').

There are also disyllabic prefixes in Plngawan where syncope does not apply, for example *makuramas* 'to get better, to make up (after an argument)' (< *ramas* 'good'), *makuɹakeh* 'to become enemies' (< *ɹakeh* 'bad'), *makuʔaraʔ* 'to wear trousers' (< *ʔaraʔ* 'trousers'). But cf. *maksapit* 'to wear shoes' (< *sapit* 'shoes') and *maktamukuʔ* 'to wear a hat' (< *tamukuʔ* 'hat'), where the prefix is *mak-* instead of *maku-*.

Plngawan vowel syncope is still poorly understood, and requires further research. A closer look at vowel weakening in Matu'uwal would also be helpful, especially its interactions with other vowel reduction processes, such as hiatus resolution. So far we only have the picture in very broad strokes, and many of the finer details remain to be uncovered.

### Paradigm leveling {#sec:paradigm-leveling}

Different Atayal dialects have various consonant and vowel alternation processes that are especially visible in verbs, thanks to the complex verb morphology of the language. These alternation processes, described in @sec:synchronic-alternations, manifest in irregular verbs, which have to be learned specifically with the correct alternations. Paradigm leveling is the reversal of this process, or put in other words, it is the regularization of irregular verbs.

This regularization or paradigm leveling process evolved at different speeds in different dialects. Some dialects, like Matu'uwal or Matu'aw, have very little if any paradigm leveling, while others, like Skikun or C'uli', regularize a large portion of irregular verbs. It may be possible that this regularization process has sped up in recent decades due to language attrition among younger speakers, however it started long before today: Ogawa records the regularized Squliq form *k\<in\>at-an* 'to bite (LV.PFV)' in the beginning of the 20th century [@ogawa1935, p. 47].

Some of the paradigm leveling processes are systematic, and affect whole classes of alternations. Other alternation processes may only be partly affected by regularization, as it can happen on a case-by-case basis. Both types are presented in this section.

Squliq, Skikun, and C'uli' completely regularize all verbs with the root-final /t/ to /c/ alternation from @sec:merger-final-c-t. @tbl:regularization-final-t-to-c shows a comparison of alternating roots in Matu'uwal and Plngawan with their cognates in Squliq, Skikun, and C'uli', which do not have this alternation.

: Regularization of root-final /t/ to /c/ in Squliq, Skikun, and C'uli' {#tbl:regularization-final-t-to-c}

| kacun     | kacun       | katun   | katun   | katun   | 'to bite (PV)'  |
| maqut     | (panaɹit)   | maqut   | maqut   | makut   | 'to ask (AV)'   |
| paqucan   | (panaɹican) | pəqutan | pəqutan | pəkutan | 'to ask (LV)'   |
| ʔingat    | (ʔumul)     | (qəmul) | mingat  | mingat  | 'to rob (AV)'   |
| ʔingacun  | (ʔulan)     | (qulan) | ngatun  | ngata   | 'to rob (PV)'   |
| maqaynut  | (rumangaʔ)  | qəmayat | qəmayat | mayat   | 'to raise (AV)' |
| qinucan   | (rangon)    | qyatan  | qyatun  | nyatan  | 'to raise (LV)' |
| humakut   | humakut     | həmakut | həmakut | makut   | 'to move (AV)'  |
| hakucun   | hakucun     | həkutun | həkutun | kutun   | 'to move (PV)'  |

The verbs in Matu'uwal and Plngawan both have a phoneme that surfaces as /t/ if it coincides with the right edge of the word, but which becomes /c/ when followed by a suffix. This alternation is completely missing in Squliq, Skikun, and C'uli', fully replaced by a non-alternating /t/. (Note that the C'uli' verb *makut\~pəkutan* 'to ask' shows an irregular sound correspondence, and is likely loaned from Squliq, more on that in Section XXX.)
<!-- TODO: add section link -->

The remaining two dialects, Matu'aw and S'uli', do preserve the alternation, although due to the merger of \*c into \*s, the alternating phoneme surfaces as /s/ before suffixes: Matu'aw *yumingat\~yingasun* 'to rob', *maʔut\~paʔusan* 'to ask', S'uli' *kəmat\~kasun* 'to bite'.

Another regularization that works in a systematic manner is the leveling of the ∅ to /s/ alternation in Skikun. In most dialects, this alternating phoneme is absent from unsuffixed forms, and instead lengthens the preceding vowel /i/ (this alternation occurs only after the vowel /i/). When suffixed, it surfaces as an /s/ in most dialects, or as /r/ in Squliq and Plngawan due to rhotacism (see @sec:other-consonant-alternations). Skikun regularized all verbs with this alternation, and added a final /s/ onto unsuffixed forms, as shown in @tbl:skikun-regularization-s.

: Skikun regularization of ∅ to /s/ alternation {#tbl:skikun-regularization-s}

| Skikun  | Matu'uwal   | Squliq   | Gloss                   |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------------------|
| mes     | mabaiy      | məbaziy  | 'to buy (AV)'           |
| bes-un  | bays-un     | bəzir-un | 'to buy (PV)'           |
| kəgis   | kəgiy       | kəgiy    | 'hemp'                  |
| kəgis-i | kamkagis-an | kəgir-i  | 'to strip hemp (PV/LV)' |

Skikun is the only Atayal dialect that has a final /s/ in these verbs, and where the roots are regular. All other dialects have irregular verbs with this alternation. There is no environment to explain this irregularity in other dialects: final /-is/ is perfectly acceptable in all dialects, e.g. Matu'uwal *cumaqis\~caqisun*, Plngawan *cumaʔis\~caʔisun*, Squliq *səmaqis\~səqisun* 'to sew'. The irregularity in words in @tbl:skikun-regularization-s must therefore be inherited, and was leveled out in Skikun only at a later stage.
<!-- Do I want to keep this here or move it to a later chapter? -->

Another alternation mentioned in @sec:other-consonant-alternations is the alternation between /ʔ/ and /l/ in a few roots, reproduced in @tbl:squliq-regularization-gs-l. The forms marked by asterisks are taken from Shih [-@shih2008, p. 16], Chen [-@chen2012, p. 137], and Egerod [-@egerod1965, p. 262], the rest come from my own field notes.

: Squliq regularization of alternating /ʔ/ and /l/ {#tbl:squliq-regularization-gs-l}

| Matu'uwal | Plngawan  | Squliq   | Gloss        |
|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| musaʔ     | musaʔ     | musaʔ    | 'to go (AV)' |
| ʔusalan   | insalan   | ʔəsan    | 'to go (LV)' |
| humicuwaʔ | huncoʔ    | həməswaʔ | 'how (AV)'   |
| həcuwalun | hacolun\* | swaʔun\* | 'how (PV)'   |

The table shows two verbs in Matu'uwal and Plngawan having an alternation between /ʔ/ in unsuffixed forms and /l/ in suffixed forms. Other dialects, like Skikun and C'uli', also have the alternation in the verb 'to go': Skikun *musaʔ\~salan*, C'uli' *mosa\~salan*. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find or elicit the PV form of 'how' in other dialects.

On the other hand, Squliq has no consonant alternation in either of these two verbs. Note that the form *swaʔun* 'how (PV)' [taken from @egerod1965, p. 262] does not show vowel coalescence, even though it applies in the forms *ʔəsan* 'to go (LV)' and *ʔəson* 'to go (PV)'. A possible explanation for this is that the regularization of these two verbs occurred at different times, with 'to go' regularizing first and therefore undergoing vowel coalescence. Other verbs in Egerod's data do show vowel coalescence in the same environment, so it is unlikely to be dialectal variation.

There are also regularizations of individual roots, that are not part of a larger pattern of regularization. For example the verb 'to close', shown in @tbl:regularization-close, has an alternating schwa vowel in the final syllable in Matu'uwal, Squliq, Skikun, and C'uli' (see @sec:historical-schwa-alternations). However it is regular in Plngawan, Matu'aw, and S'uli'.

: Regularization of the verb 'to close' in Plngawan, Matu'aw, and S'uli' {#tbl:regularization-close}

| Matu'uwal | Squliq  | Plngawan | Matu'aw | S'uli' | Gloss           |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------|--------|-----------------|

| qalʔan    | qələʔan | ʔulon    | ʔalwan  | ʔəlwan | 'to close (PV)' |

The PV forms in Matu'aw and S'uli' have the vowel /u/ changing into a glide /w/ before the LV suffix *-an*, which happens with non-alternating vowels. Plngawan coalesces the two vowels into a mid vowel /o/, as it usually does (see @sec:vowel-coalescence). Compare this to the Squliq PV form *qələʔan* or the C'uli' *ləʔan*, where there is no gliding or vowel coalescence and the glottal stop is preserved. However, this regularization is not part of a larger pattern of regularizing historical schwa vowels in Plngawan, Matu'aw, and S'uli', and is instead a one-off case.

Plngawan also regularizes some verbs with the /k/ to /p/ alternation in the root. Plngawan, along with C'uli', merges labials into velars word-finally (see @sec:merger-labial-velar). However, in a few verbs in my data, this neutralized velar was then extended to suffixed forms as well, as shown in @tbl:regularization-plngawan-p-k.

: Regularization of some /p/ to /k/ alternating verbs in Plngawan {#tbl:regularization-plngawan-p-k}

| maloɹak   | qumaluwap  | 'to hunt (AV)'    |
| paloɹakan | qaqluwapan | 'hunting grounds' |
| panek     | panaip     | 'to fish (AV)'    |
| panekan   | panaypan   | 'to fish (LV)'    |

There are still many verbs in Plngawan that preserve the /p/ to /k/ alternation, e.g. *maɹuk\~kaɹupan* 'to enter', *yumuk\~yupun* 'to blow', *hunyak\~hayapan* 'to suck'. The verbs in @tbl:regularization-plngawan-p-k may have been regularized because their suffixed forms are not used very often in everyday speech, and have since been attrited.

## Interim summary

In this chapter I looked at the phonological systems of seven different Atayal dialects, and explored their consonant and vowel inventories, syllable structure, phonotactics, as well as synchronic alternations.

In the past, such studies have mostly been limited to just one dialect. Even @li1980 wrote mostly about alternations in Squliq, though he did include some limited information on other dialects as well.

This chapter is a state-of-the-art look at the comparative phonology of Atayal. I have tried to devote equal space to all dialects, though some unfortunately remain understudied. I have also included the results of studies done on Atayal since @li1980, especially those that deal with its synchronic phonology.

I hope this chapter adequately shows the diversity of Atayal dialects in various areas of phonology. Vowel systems can range from as few as three vowels to as many as six, there may or may not be restrictions on closed syllables, vowels outside the head foot, and certain consonants in word-final position.

Consonant inventories are quite similar between Atayal dialects. The main differences reside in the presence or absence of /c/ and /q/ as separate phonemes. Plngawan is the only Atayal dialect to have /ɹ/ as a distinct phoneme.

The phonotactics of consonants vary more than the inventories themselves. The only dialect that allows voiced obstruents /b/ and /g/ to occur word-finally is Matu'uwal (although Matu'aw speakers still preserved final /g/ when Paul Li was doing his fieldwork there around 1980). Matu'uwal and Matu'aw are the only two dialects where /x/ can occur word-initially, and only in one or two words (unless we count word-initial devoiced /g/ in Skikun as /x/). Plngawan and C'uli' disallow labials in word-final position, merging them with velars. The glottal stop appears to have largely lost its functional load in word-final position in both S'uli' and C'uli', thus it is not marked in this dissertation; other dialects still distinguish final glottal stops from final open syllables quite clearly.

Most Atayal dialects have mid vowels /e/ and /o/ in some form: Matu'uwal and Matu'aw are the exceptions. In other dialects, mid vowels are commonly the result of coalescence of two vowels or a diphthong, or sometimes vowel assimilation or lowering effects of nearby consonants. Schwa appears in most dialects, with only Plngawan and Matu'aw lacking it, though it can never be stressed.

Syllable structure shows some minor differences. Matu'uwal is the only dialect that allows onsetless syllables (but only in final position, thus forming a hiatus in the final foot). Closed syllables are allowed word-finally in all dialects, but are much more limited in non-final position: Matu'uwal and Plngawan allow them everywhere, whereas in other dialects they are mostly restricted to morpheme boundaries [there is significant variation in Squliq, see @huang2015].

There are some commonalities in synchronic alternations, and they include both inherited irregularities as well as those developed separately due to drift (and perhaps language contact). There are also tendencies to regularize some of these irregularities, and these can be more prominent in some dialects than in others. There is still enough irregularity spread across different dialects to be able to trace it back to their origin, Proto-Atayal.

The most commonly found alternation is probably /c/ to /t/, with /c/ surfacing before suffixes, as in Matu'uwal *k\<um\>at\~kac-un* 'to bite'. Other alternations, such as ∅ to /s/, or /ʔ/ to /l/, are found in only a very small number of words. These have mostly been well-preserved across the Atayal dialects, the former only being regularized in Skikun, and the latter in Squliq.

Regularization processes in verbal paradigms should not be overlooked when conducting historical linguistic research. They may give the appearance of inherited regularity, or else a special environment, where there is none. The impact of regularization on historical reconstructions is discussed in Section XXX.

# Proto-Atayal phonology {#sec:proto-atayal-phonology}

In this chapter, I use the comparative method to reconstruct the phonological system of Proto-Atayal. @sec:sound-correspondences presents the sound correspondences between Atayal dialects in order to reconstruct the individual phonemes of Proto-Atayal. The full phoneme inventory of Proto-Atayal is presented in @sec:proto-atayal-phoneme-inventory. The syllable structure and phonotactic restrictions of Proto-Atayal are listed in @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics. I also examine external evidence for reconstructions in @sec:external-evidence-phono, both from closely related Seediq and from reconstructed Proto-Austronesian words. The sound changes from Proto-Atayal to each individual dialect are presented in @sec:proto-atayal-to-dialects, and @sec:pan-to-proto-atayal examines the sound correspondences between Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Atayal.

## Sound correspondences {#sec:sound-correspondences}

This section presents the sound correspondences of individual phonemes, used to reconstruct phonemes and lexical items in Proto-Atayal. It is further subdivided into sections on consonant correspondences (@sec:consonant-correspondences), vowel correspondences in the final two syllables (@sec:vowel-correspondences), vowel correspondences in the third-to-last syllable and beyond (@sec:prepenult-vowel-correspondences), and a discussion on Paul Li's Proto-Atayalic final \*-d and \*-g' phonemes in Proto-Atayal (@sec:irregular-correspondences-proto-atayal).

### Consonant correspondences {#sec:consonant-correspondences}

Each consonant protophoneme is reconstructed based on correspondences in several environments: word-initial, word-medial, and word-final (where applicable). For those protophonemes which have additional reflexes in more specific environments, those environtments are included as well.

The correspondence of Proto-Atayal \*p is generally regular, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-p. Word-initial and word-medial reflexes are /p/ in all dialects. Word-finally, \*p is reflected as /p/ in all dialects except Plngawan and C'uli', where it is /k/ in this position instead.

| Proto-Atayal | \*paraʔ   | \*ɹapit           | \*ʔumiyup |   |

The reason for the velar reflex in Plngawan and C'uli' is a process by which final labials merge with velars in these two dialects. This process is detailed in @sec:merger-labial-velar. Note that in both Plngawan and C'uli' the historical \*p surfaces when the verb is suffixed: *yupan* 'to blow (LV)'.

Proto-Atayal \*t is mostly reflected as /t/, though in certain positions it may become an affricate, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-t.

| Proto-Atayal | \*tunux | \*matisal   | \*maŋutiq | \*qutux | \*mit  |

In Squliq, \*t is always reflected as an affricate before /i/ or its corresponding glide /y/. Skikun does occasionally allow the sequence /ti/, although it is very rare (see @sec:skikun-phonotactics). In C'uli' and S'uli', words with and without affrication can be found. Sometimes even the same word may exhibit two variants, e.g.: *timu* or *cimu* 'salt', *tikay* or *cikay* 'a little, a bit', *hyuti* or *hyuci* 'slippery'. There is variation from village to village and speaker to speaker, and sometimes even within a single speaker's speech. The most likely source of this dichotomy is Squliq, see @sec:interdialectal-borrowings for further discussion.

In word-final position, /t/ may also be pronounced as a dental affricate [ts] by some speakers, as mentioned in @sec:merger-final-c-t. This is dependent on individual speakers: I personally have witnessed both the presence and absence of this pronunciation from different speakers of Squliq, Skikun, Plngawan, and S'uli'. This is simply a variant pronunciation of /t/ word-finally, and not a different phoneme, so it is not taken into consideration here.

The correspondences of \*k, shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-k, are mostly /k/ in all dialect. In some environments, in was backed into /q/ in Squliq, Skikun, and Matu'uwal.

This assimilation process was noted in Li [-@li1980, p. 377] for Squliq and Skikun. The environment for this change is a following /h/ or /q/ in the root [@li1981, p. 248]. A similar assimilation also took place in the closely related Seediq language [@lee2009]. Occasionally, Squliq or Skikun also back \*k into /q/ sporadically.
<!-- TODO: add link for last sentence -->

In Matu'uwal, *k*-backing can only be found in three roots in my dataset: /quriq/ 'to steal', /qaniq/ 'to eat', and /qəbaq/ 'to know'. All three are disyllabic and end with /q/ (the initial /q/ comes from historical \*k). However, the initial /q/ does not surface in the roots 'to eat' and 'to know' except in subjunctive Actor Voice forms: *maniq* 'to eat (AV)', *niqun* 'to eat (PV)', *baq* 'to know (AV)', *baqun* 'to know (PV)'. Note that even though /qumuriq/ has three syllables, the root is /quriq/, which is disyllabic, with *-um-* being the Actor Voice infix. In contrast /kahuniq/ has three syllables in the root and retains initial /k/.

Proto-Atayal \*q is reflected as /q/ in Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun, and as /ʔ/ in other dialects. The correspondences can be seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-q.

As stated in @sec:suli-phonotactics and @sec:culi-phonotactics, I analyze S'uli' and C'uli' as having no phonemic glottal stops in word-final position. This applies to words with historical word-final \*q as well.

Note that vowel coalescence in the final foot does not apply in roots with historical \*q, as mentioned in @sec:vowel-coalescence. Unlike roots with historical \*ʔ, here the glottal stop is preserved, as seen in Plngawan *cumaʔis*, C'uli' *cəmaʔes*, Matu'aw *sumaʔis* 'to sew'. If an intervocalic \*q precedes the final syllable, its reflex is /ʔ/ in S'uli' and Matu'aw, but ∅ in Plngawan and C'uli': S'uli' and Matu'aw *waʔanux*, Plngawan and C'uli' *wanux* 'sambar deer'.

The glottal stop is preserved in initial position in all dialects, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-glot. Word-finally, C'uli' and S'uli' appear to have lost the distinction between final /ʔ/ and final open syllables, and therefore I do not consider them to have final glottal stops.

Word-medial glottal stops in Proto-Atayal appear to have been rare outside suffixed forms, and here Matu'uwal is the only dialect that reliably preserves them. The exception here are word-medial glottal stops preceded by a schwa, as in 'to feed' in @tbl:proto-atayal-glot. In other cases, word-medial glottal stops surrounded by full vowels were deleted in all dialects except Matu'uwal. The vowels on either side of the historical \*ʔ were coalesced into a GV sequence or a single vowel: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > Matu'uwal *riʔax*, Skikun *ryax*, Plngawan *rex*. This process is identical to suffixation-induced vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of these dialects, described in @sec:vowel-coalescence.

Proto-Atayal \*b is reflected as /b/ in word-initial and word-medial positions in all dialects, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-b. Note that the phoneme /b/ may phonetically be a bilabial plosive [b], a bilabial fricative [β], or a labiodental fricative [v]. These different phonetic realizations are treated as identical on the phonemic level.

Word-final \*b is only preserved as /b/ in Matu'uwal. In all other dialects it is devoiced, and in Plngawan and C'uli' its place of articulation becomes velar instead of labial in addition to devoicing.

| Proto-Atayal | \*baŋaʔ  | \*ʔabag  | \*pahəgub | \*qumatab            |

Word-final \*b may be reconstructed based on Matu'uwal evidence, or based on consonant alternations in verbal roots. For example, the verb *qəmatap* 'to cut with scissors' in Squliq becomes *qətaban* when suffixed, revealing the underlying /b/ phoneme. However, this process is not infallible: the Plngawan cognate *ʔumatak* becomes *ʔatapan* after suffixation, still preserving the labial feature of the final root consonant, but losing the voicing.

Proto-Atayal \*g is regularly reflected as /g/ in all dialects in word-initial and word-medial positions, with the exception of Skikun, where initial /g/ tends to be devoiced into /x/ in an ongoing merger of these two phonemes (see @sec:skikun-consonants). Word-finally it is lenited in most dialects except Matu'uwal and Skikun, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-g.

Word-final \*g is preserved as /g/ in Matu'uwal and as /x/ in Skikun when preceded by /a/ or /u/. According to Li's [-@li1980;-@li1981] data, Matu'aw^[Called "Matabalay" in Li's publications.] still preserved final /g/ even following an /i/ when he was conducting his fieldwork on the dialect around 1980. Even during that time, only speakers above the age of 60 still preserved it, whereas "younger" speakers (around 50 years old at the time) no longer had it in word-final position [@li1980, p. 385]. Naturally, it had been completely lost by the time I conducted my fieldwork on Matu'aw in early 2020. Li's data can be used to reconstruct final \*g in several lexical items. Likewise, Seediq cognates can also be used to identify words with historical final \*-ig, see @sec:evidence-from-seediq-phono for more details.

In other dialects, word-final \*g is reflected as a glide after the low vowel /a/, as seen in reflexes of \*ʔabag 'leaves' in the table. After high vowels (including Matu'uwal and Skikun for reflexes of \*-ig), it manifests itself as vowel length, e.g. Proto-Atayal \*ŋuhug 'nose' > Squliq *nguhuw* [ŋu.ˈħuː], Proto-Atayal \*wahig 'vine' > Squliq *wahiy* [wa.ˈħiː]. Long vowels in the final syllable are traditionally written with a homorganic glide following the long vowel, both by linguists and Atayal speakers (only Matu'uwal has long low vowel /a/, which is normally left unmarked).

Verbs with historical final \*-ig have an alternating /s/ that appears in suffixed forms, for example Matu'uwal *rumahiy\~rahisan* 'to dry in the air'. There are only a few of such verbs; see also discussion in @sec:other-consonant-alternations.

However, not all lexical items with final *-iy* in modern dialects had a \*g coda in Proto-Atayal. Several examples are discussed in @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics.

Proto-Atayal \*c is reflected as /c/ in all dialects except Squliq, S'uli', and Matu'aw, where it merges with \*s, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-c.

| Proto-Atayal | \*cumaqis | \*cumiyuk   | \*wacilung   |

The phoneme /c/ does not appear in word-final position in any Atayal dialect, but it does alternate with /t/ in verbal roots, as explained in @sec:merger-final-c-t. This alternation can be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal, and there is no evidence that \*c appeared word-finally. See @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics for more details.

Proto-Atayal \*s is reflected as /s/ everywhere except one very specific environment in Plngawan and Squliq, where it undergoes rhotacism. The correspondences are shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-s.

: Correspondences of Proto-Atayal \*s {#tbl:proto-atayal-s}

| Proto-Atayal | \*siniyug | \*pisaniq | \*ʔisah         | \*musaʔ |

The environment for rhotacism in Plngawan and Squliq is identical: \*s became /r/ when preceded by the vowel /i/ and followed by a stressed vowel (i.e. final vowel). Thus, Proto-Atayal words like \*ʔisah 'sister-in-law'^[English does not have a specific enough translation for this word. It refers to the wife of one's older brother, but I translate it as 'sister-in-law' in the text and the table for brevity.], \*pisaʔ 'how many', \*kisaʔ 'today, soon' become *ʔirah*, *piraʔ*, and *kiraʔ*, respectively, in both Plngawan and Squliq. If the vowel preceding \*s is anything other than \*i, rhotacism does not occur, e.g. Proto-Atayal \*musaʔ 'to go (AV)' > Plngawan, Squliq *musaʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*taɹasi 'straw hat' > Plngawan *taɹasiʔ*, Squliq *cyasiʔ*. Neither does it happen if the vowel following \*s is not the stressed (final) vowel: Proto-Atayal \*pisaniq 'taboo' > Plngawan *pisaniʔ*, Squliq *pəsaniq*.
<!-- TODO: draw pretty rule scheme -->

The rhotacism rule is also subject to paradigm leveling (see @sec:paradigm-leveling). Verbs with roots ending in /-is/ do not undergo rhotacism, e.g. Plngawan *mangilis\~cangisan* and Squliq *məngilis\~ləngisan* 'to cry' (note the metathesis between the AV and LV forms). On the other hand, verbs with the ∅\~s alternation have an alternating /r/ in Plngawan and Squliq instead: Squliq *məbaziy\~bəzirun* 'to buy', Plngawan *magiy\~pageran* 'to run away'. See @sec:other-consonant-alternations for more examples of these alternations.

Proto-Atayal \*x is regularly reflected as /x/ in all dialects, except in reflexes of the word \*xuɹil 'dog', as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-x.

| Proto-Atayal | \*xuɹil | \*caxaʔ        | \*ŋarux |

There is only a single protoform where I reconstruct initial \*x, and that is \*xuɹil 'dog'. Most dialects do not allow /x/ to appear word-initially at all, and those that do only have one or two words with initial /x/. Skikun is an exception due to its merger of \*x and \*g. Also because of this merger, intervocalic \*x may sometimes be reflected as a voiced fricative /g/ instead. See @sec:skikun-consonants for details.

Proto-Atayal \*h is regularly reflected as /h/ in all positions across all dialects, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-h.

| Proto-Atayal | \*hahabuk | \*kuhiŋ      | \*kuməluh    |

In Plngawan, historical /h/ may sometimes be realized as [x] before high or mid vowels, merging with /x/. This appears to be an ongoing merger in the dialect, as mentioned in @sec:plngawan-consonants.

The correspondences of Proto-Atayal \*m are regular, with reflexes being /m/ except word-finally in Plngawan and C'uli', as demonstrated in @tbl:proto-atayal-m.

The word-final reflex of Proto-Atayal \*m in Plngawan and C'uli' is /ng/. This is exactly the same process that affects word-final \*b and \*p, and is further discussed in @sec:merger-labial-velar.

| Proto-Atayal | \*nanukaʔ    | \*waqanux     | \*tawkan  | \*balihun |

Some speakers may pronounce this phoneme as a velar nasal [ŋ] word-finally, and my transcription of C'uli' 'door' as *bəlihung* reflects this. However, this velar pronunciation is not always consistent, and varies from speaker to speaker. This may indicate the beginnings of a merger between /n/ and /ng/ in word-final position.

Word-final \*l may be reflected as /n/ in the speech of some speakers. This is common in the speech of younger speakers across the spectrum of Atayal dialects, however in my fieldwork on S'uli' and C'uli', this sound change was present even with older speakers, and appears to be complete there. There is much individual variation with how final \*l is reflected, with /n/ being a more 'innovative' pronunciation that transcends dialect boundaries. See @sec:merger-final-l-n for more information on this sound change.

The reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*r are generally /r/ in word-initial and word-medial positions, except in cases of liquid assimilation. Word-final reflexes of \*r are less systematic. Some examples are given in @tbl:proto-atayal-r.

| Proto-Atayal | \*raluʔ | \*raum   | \*paraʔ   | \*humaur   | \*tamur |

Liquid assimilation happens in Squliq, Skikun, S'uli', and C'uli'. If an onset \*r was followed by an \*l in the onset of another syllable, the \*r changed to /l/. Thus, Proto-Atayal \*raluʔ 'name' > Squliq, Skikun *laluʔ*.
<!-- TODO: sound change scheme -->

This liquid assimilation was not triggered if \*l was in a syllable coda, whether in the same syllable as \*r or a different one: e.g. (PAn \*dapaN >) Proto-Atayal \*rapal 'sole (of foot)' > Squliq, Skikun *rapal*, or Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Squliq, Skikun *kəneril*.

Reflexes of word-final \*r are not very systematic across dialects. It may be reflected as /r/ or as /l/ (and in S'uli' and C'uli' as /n/ due to the \*l > /n/ sound change word-finally). For example, in @tbl:proto-atayal-r, the reflexes of \*r in Proto-Atayal \*humaur 'to flood' are /r/ in Matu'uwal, Skikun, C'uli', and Squliq; but neither C'uli' nor Squliq preserve the final \*r in Proto-Atayal \*tamur 'yeast' (reconstructed based on the Matu'uwal reflex *tamur*). Apparently Matu'uwal did not preserve final \*r in all cases either: for example in Proto-Atayal \*kaʔur 'Taiwan beauty snake' (錦蛇) > Matu'uwal *kaul*, but Squliq, Skikun, C'uli' *kor*.

All in all, the inconsistency of the reflexes of final \*r makes it difficult to reconstruct with certainty. For verbal roots, suffixed forms may be used, e.g. the Patient Voice form of 'to flood': Proto-Atayal \*hawrun 'to flood (PV)' > Matu'uwal, Matu'aw *hawrun*, Skikun, C'uli' *horun*. Here all dialects reflect an \*r, including Matu'aw, which has a final /l/ in the AV form *humawl*. However, this strategy may not always work to due paradigm leveling: see the example with reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*qumur 'to seize', shown in @tbl:paradigm-leveling-qumur.

In both Squliq and Plngawan, even suffixed reflexes have an /l/ in the root, even though \*r should not generally be neutralized in this environment: Proto-Atayal \*quran 'to seize (LV)' > Plngawan *ʔulan*, Squliq *pəqulan* 'to take from each other (LV)'. Here the neutralization must have originally happened in reflexes of the Actor Voice form, where \*r was final, and then spread to suffixed forms due to paradigm leveling. We can reconstruct \*r here based on reflexes in Matu'uwal and Skikun. For more on paradigm leveling in Atayal, see @sec:paradigm-leveling.

Proto-Atayal had a second rhotic, \*ɹ, which has only been preserved in Plngawan. All other dialects have merged it with other segments or deleted it. The reason for reconstructing this cross-linguistically rare sound is addressed in @sec:proto-atayal-phoneme-inventory. Plngawan preserves \*ɹ as a retroflex approximant with no changes, while all other dialects except Matu'uwal merge it with /y/, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-approx-r. The Matu'uwal correspondences are a little more complicated.

The regular reflex of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ in Matu'uwal is ∅. Word-finally, its deletion triggered compensatory lengthening in the preceding vowel, thus Proto-Atayal \*lihuɹ 'forehead' > Matu'uwal *lihuw* [li.ˈħuː]. The \<w\> here is just a spelling convention to indicate a final long [uː] vowel, and not a phonemic glide. This lengthening effect can be seen in the low vowel /a/ as well: Proto-Atayal \*takaɹ 'frog' > Matu'uwal *taka* [ta.ˈkaː]. No words with final \*-iɹ are found in my dataset, but it is hard to tell whether this is due to insufficient data, an accidental gap, or a phonotactic restriction.

Between vowels, \*ɹ was always deleted in Matu'uwal. This is the source of all identical vowel hiatuses in the language (/a.a/, /i.i/, and /u.u/), for example Proto-Atayal \*kaɹal 'sky' > Matu'uwal *kaal* [ka.ˈal], Proto-Atayal \*ʔuɹuk 'pup (animal offspring)' > Matu'uwal *ʔuuk* [ʔu.ˈuk]. A glide can be found in some words with historical \*ɹ, e.g. Proto-Atayal \*xuɹil 'dog' > Matu'uwal *xuwil*, or Proto-Atayal \*mahuɹiq 'wet' > Matu'uwal *mahuwiq*, however **this is not a case of \*r > w in Matu'uwal**. A different glide surfaces when \*ɹ was preceded by \*i, as in Proto-Atayal \*sumiɹahuq 'to be late' > Matu'uwal *sumiyahuq* (cf. Plngawan *sunɹahuʔ*). The glides were inserted later, after the deletion of \*ɹ, and were conditioned by the preceding vowel.

Words that began with \*ɹ in Proto-Atayal tend to have an initial glottal stop in Matu'uwal: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Matu'uwal *ʔungay*, Proto-Atayal \*ɹimagal 'five' > Matu'uwal *ʔimagal* (cf. PAn \*lima). The initial glottal stop was likely added to these words after the deletion of \*ɹ in order to prevent vowel-initial words, rather than a direct change of \*ɹ > ʔ. Words with a low vowel following an initial \*ɹ have two variant forms, based on two subdialects of Matu'uwal: Tabilas and Sahiyang [@li1981, p. 264]. Thus, Proto-Atayal \*ɹapit 'flying squirrel' > Matu'uwal *ʔapit* or *wapit*. Almost all (though not completely all) reflexes of words with initial \*ɹa- in Proto-Atayal still have these variant pronunciations.

In short, Proto-Atayal \*ɹ was deleted in Matu'uwal, except in word-initial position before \*a in one subdialect. Additional repair strategies were triggered by its deletion in some environments. Its deletion in word-final position triggered compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel.

There is another very specific environment where Proto-Atayal \*ɹ was not simply deleted, and that is \*-wr- clusters. Such clusters could only be allowed where there was an \*aw sequence in one syllable, followed by an \*ɹ onset in the following syllable. Only a few cases can be found in my data, shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-wr.

| Proto-Atayal | \*rawɹiq | \*gumawɹag | \*mawɹit   |

Here all other dialects have their regular correspondences, with the usual caveats: in both S'uli' and Squliq, /aw/ may be coalesced into /o/ or not, depending on the speaker. Matu'uwal has a geminate /w/ in all three words (although final /k/ in *mawwik* 'to drill' is irregular). Unlike words with initial \*ɹa- in Proto-Atayal, there is no subdialect distinction here. It should thus be treated as a separate change of \*ɹ > w /w\_. It is unclear if a similar gemination process would happen after the glide \*y, as I have not been able to find cognates with such a sequence. Matu'uwal *ʔayyung* 'soup' may be a possible candidate (and the only word in Matu'uwal with geminate /y/ that I have found), but there is insufficient evidence from other dialects to make an accurate reconstruction.

Proto-Atayal \*w is reflected as /w/ in most positions. In trisyllabic words, \*w was fortitioned into a fricative in several dialects, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-w. The data is scarce, and it is difficult to accurately identify the specific environment where it occurred for each dialect.

| Proto-Atayal | \*wariyuŋ | \*wakil   | \*waqanux     | \*wauʔ   |

In Squliq and Skikun, fortition occurs reliably in trisyllabic words, i.e. when the vowel following \*w is lenited into a schwa: Proto-Atayal \*waqanux 'sambar deer' > Squliq, Skikun *bəqanux*, Proto-Atayal \*waciluŋ 'pond, lake' > Squliq *bəsilung*, Skikun *bəcilung*. However while in the preceding two examples \*w fortitioned into /b/, in other words it became /g/, for example Proto-Atayal \*wariyuŋ 'neck' > Squliq, Skikun *gəryung*. More recently, some Squliq subdialects have also begun to fortition /w/ in other positions, for example Proto-Atayal \*wauʔ 'pigeon' > Squliq *goʔ*, or Proto-Atayal \*wagiʔ 'Sun' > Squliq *gwagiʔ* (variant of *wagiʔ*).

Other dialects have fortition happen more sporadically: Proto-Atayal \*wariyuŋ 'neck' > C'uli' *gəryung*, S'uli' *rəgyung* (with metathesis), but neither dialect has fortition in reflexes of \*waqanux 'sambar deer'. Plngawan has *gilung* 'chicken' < Proto-Atayal \*wayluŋ, but no other instances of \*w-fortition.

Other occurrences of \*w, such as in the 'diphthong' \*aw or in the sequences \*-uwa-, are discussed separately in @sec:vowel-correspondences, as they tend to change as a single unit.

Proto-Atayal \*y is reflected as /y/ in all dialects, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-y. Squliq and S'uli' fortition this phoneme in some environments, but it is phonologically conditioned, and thus not a true split.

Proto-Atayal \*ə did not occur in the final (stressed) syllable. The following is a discussion of reflexes of penultimate \*ə. In Squliq, Skikun, S'uli', and C'uli' it remained /ə/. In Matu'aw, it merged into /a/ in all cases. In Matu'uwal and Plngawan, there were various changes, conditioned by the environment. The reflexes are shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-schwa.

| Proto-Atayal | \*qalətiŋ | \*bəhut    | \*bəling | \*həɹiŋ | \*matəɹuʔ |

In both Matu'uwal and Plngawan, penultimate \*ə was deleted in trisyllabic words: Proto-Atayal \*qalətiŋ '(wooden) plank' > Matu'uwal *qalting*, Plngawan *ʔalting*, or Proto-Atayal \*cuməxuʔ 'to pound grains (AV)' > Matu'uwal *cumxuʔ*, Plngawan *cungxuʔ* (with nasal assimilation). In disyllabic words, Matu'uwal preserved the vowel as /ə/, but Plngawan changed it into a full vowel: either a copy of the final vowel, or /a/. For example, Proto-Atayal \*bəhut 'squirrel' > Matu'uwal *bəhut*, Plngawan *buhut* (vowel copying), but Proto-Atayal \*bəliŋ 'crack, gap' > Matu'uwal *bəling*, Plngawan *baling*. The choice of repair strategy is opaque when the final vowel is /a/, and can only be determined when the final vowel is high. Regrettably, there are very few items in Proto-Atayal that satisfy all the necessary conditions (disyllabic, penultimate \*ə, final high vowel) and also have a reflex in Plngawan. Apart from the items in @tbl:proto-atayal-schwa, there are only two such words in my dataset: Proto-Atayal \*kəhuʔ 'granary' > Plngawan *kuhuʔ*, and Proto-Atayal \*ɹəɹik 'deep' > Plngawan *ɹaɹik*. More data is required to determine the regular correspondence correctly.

Additionally, if penultimate \*ə was followed by \*ɹ, a different sound change took place in Matu'uwal. Since the regular correspondence of \*ɹ in this dialect is ∅, the application of this sound change put \*ə directly before the final vowel, where it fully assimilated, producing a hiatus with two identical vowels: Proto-Atayal \*həɹiŋ 'honey' > Matu'uwal *hiing*, Proto-Atayal \*matəɹuʔ 'six' > Matu'uwal *mamatuuʔ*.

The sequence \*ay in Proto-Atayal monophthongized into /e/ in many dialects when occurring in the penultimate syllable. In @tbl:proto-atayal-ay, all dialects except for Matu'uwal and Matu'aw have this change, although some conservative speakers of other dialects, such as Squliq or S'uli', may still preserve /ay/ in penultimate syllables. In the final syllable, Proto-Atayal \*ay is regularly reflected as /ay/ except in Plngawan, where the reflex is /iy/.

| Proto-Atayal | \*kanayril | *bayhuɹ | \*ɹuŋay  | \*waɹay |

In Matu'uwal, final \*ay became /iy/ when it was directly preceded by /a/ without an intervening consonant: \*-aay > *-aiy*. The only way this environment could arise was through the deletion of \*ɹ. Thus Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Matu'uwal *ʔungay*, but Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > Matu'uwal *waiy*. This also applied in words where a penultimate \*ə assimilated to /a/ after the deletion of \*ɹ: Proto-Atayal \*makəɹay 'dry' > Matu'uwal *makaiy*, cf. Plngawan *makɹiy*, Squliq *məkəzyay*.

In parallel with \*ay, Proto-Atayal \*aw was monophthongized into /o/ in penultimate position in most dialects, except Matu'uwal and Matu'aw, though more conservative speakers of other dialects may also preserve the diphthong pronunciation. In final position, its regular reflex is /aw/ in all dialects, with the possible exception of Plngawan, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-aw.

Plngawan has /uː/ for Proto-Atayal \*-aw in two words in my dataset: Proto-Atayal \*ləhəbaw 'light (weight)' > Plngawan *lahbuw*, and Proto-Atayal \*mVhəŋaw 'to rest' > Plngawan *mahnguw*. Proto-Atayal \*-huɹaw 'to walk downhill' > Plngawan *puhuɹaw*, and Proto-Atayal \*humilaw 'to cover (with blanket)' > Plngawan *humilaw*. The regular correspondence is difficult to determine from such a small set. Additionally, the Plngawan word *ʔaguw* 'wine, alcohol' may be a regular reflex of Proto-Atayal \*quwaw, with fortition of the medial glide (see below for reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*-uwa-), which would make it the third Plngawan word to reflect \*-aw as *-uw* in my dataset.

The following three correspondences are of the sequences \*-uwa-, \*-iya-, and \*-iyu-. These sequences were disyllabic in Proto-Atayal, but changed as a single unit in some dialects. The evidence that they were indeed disyllabic comes from Matu'uwal, which retains them as disyllabic, and from sound changes. One example of such sound changes is vowel weakening in dialects like Squliq and S'uli': these sequences all behaved as two syllables with regard to the application of vowel weakening. Since there is no evidence for a light/heavy syllable distinction in Atayal, and since vowel weakening operated based on the syllable count, they must have been disyllabic. Moreover, changes of \*-uwa- and \*-iya- before \*q in Plngawan also preserve disyllabicity. The glides between two vowels may have been phonemic or strictly phonetic, but they must have been present, based on the reflexes in modern dialects. Here, I choose to write them out.

The sequence \*-uwa- in Proto-Atayal became monosyllabic in most dialects, with the exception of Matu'uwal and possibly S'uli'. Other than that, it only underwent additional changes in Plngawan. The correspondences are given in @tbl:proto-atayal-uwa.

In Plngawan, \*-uwa- regularly coalesced into /o/ in most cases, both when word-final and when followed by another syllable: Proto-Atayal \*buwax 'unhusked rice' > Plngawan *box*, Proto-Atayal \*suwagiʔ 'sister-in-law' > Plngawan *sogiʔ*. However, when it was immediately preceded by \*q, it changed into /awa/ instead, for example Proto-Atayal \*quwalax 'rain' > Plngawan *ʔawalax*, but compare \*qumuwalax 'to rain' (with the Actor Voice infix \<um\>) > Plngawan *ʔumolax*, with vowel coalescence instead. The addition of an infix split \*q away from the sequence \*-uwa-, and the regular coalescence to /o/ took place instead. The same alternation can also be seen in Proto-Atayal \*qumuwax 'to wash dishes (AV)' > Plngawan *ʔumox*, but Proto-Atayal \*quwaxan 'to wash dishes (PV)' > Plngawan *ʔawaxan*.

Proto-Atayal \*-iya- developed in a parallel way with \*-uwa-: it coalesced into a single syllable in most dialects, with Matu'uwal being the exception, and it regularly monophthongized into /e/ in Plngawan, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-iya.

Plngawan changed \*-iya- to /e/ both on the right edge, and when followed by other syllables: Proto-Atayal \*qusiyaʔ 'water' > Plngawan *ʔuseʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*pagiyasan 'to run away (LV)' > Plngawan *pageran*. It may have had a different change following \*q, just like the case with \*-uwa-, seen in Proto-Atayal \*maqiyanux 'alive' > Plngawan *mayanux*. There is only one item in my dataset where \*q immediately precedes \*-iya-, and there is additional vowel coalescence in *mayanux*. Based on the change of \*-uwa- to /awa/ before \*q, we would expect \*-iya- to change to /aya/, which is indeed the case here.

Coalescence of \*-iya- to /e/ is blocked in several Plngawan forms. One of these is *syaw* 'rim, edge, shore' (< Proto-Atayal \*siyag), instead of the expected \*\*sew. Most likely, the sound change was underapplied to avoid the infelicitous sequence /ew/, which does not appear in Plngawan. It was also not applied in the 3SG pronoun *hiyaʔ*, but it is often the case cross-linguistically that pronouns are not subject to the same sound changes as the rest of the lexicon.

Proto-Atayal \*-iyu- developed similarly to the sequences \*-uwa- and \*-iya-, becoming monosyllabic in all dialects except Matu'uwal. In Plngawan, it regularly coalesced into a monophthong /i/, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-iyu.

| Proto-Atayal | \*cumiyuk    | \*giyus | \*luliyuŋ | \*siniyug |

Some words in Plngawan do not exhibit the change of \*-iyu- to /i/, for example Proto-Atayal \*siniyug 'rope' > Plngawan *sinyuw*. It should be noted that the sequences [ju] and [iw] can sound very similar, however I recorded the form *sinyuw* as [ɕi.ˈnjuː], with the syllable peak on /u/ and the vowel itself lengthened. Here, I believe the rule was underapplied to avoid the infelicitous sequence /iw/, much like with *syaw* 'rim, edge'.

There is one Plngawan word in my dataset where coalescence did not occur when expected: *lahyung* 'mortar'. It is an outlier, but unlike *sinyuw* 'rope', it does not have an environment that would explain the sound change not being applied here (/hiŋ/ is a valid syllable in Plngawan, e.g. *lumuhing* 'to continue', so it cannot have been to avoid an infelicitous syllable).

### Prepenultimate vowel correspondences {#sec:prepenult-vowel-correspondences}

Of the seven dialects under discussion here, only Matu'uwal, Plngawan, and Matu'aw still preserve phonemic distinctions in the third-to-last vowel (see [@sec:matuuwal-phonotactics;@sec:plngawan-phonotactics;@sec:matuaw-phonotactics]). It is thus possible to reconstruct vowels in the third-to-last syllable and even beyond, by using the evidence from these three dialects. In this section, I will specifically concentrate on third-to-last vowels, partly because very few roots are longer than three syllables, and partly because fourth-to-last vowels present different challenges due to vowel lenition processes.

In many cases, all three dialects agree on the third-to-last vowel, in which case the reconstruction is straightforward. The vowels \*a, \*i, and \*u can all be reconsructed this way, as shown in @tbl:prepen-same-vowel.

Many of the protoforms in @tbl:prepen-same-vowel have the segments \*q or \*ɹ, which have different reflexes in these dialects. All correspondences are regular, so we can be fairly certain these words were directly inherited.

Alternations of Proto-Atayal \*ə in the final syllable of verbal roots were discussed in @sec:historical-schwa-alternations. There were also verbs with \*ə in the initial syllable of disyllabic roots, which did not surface in Matu'uwal and Plngawan when the verb was prefixed or infixed, but did appear in suffixed forms. It is reflected as /a/ in most cases, as seen in @tbl:cecvc-verbs-ml-pl.^[I do not have sufficient Matu'aw data to include it in the table, but I expect all instances of \*ə to regularly become /a/ regardless of position, for example Proto-Atayal \*kələhun 'to reap (PV)' > Matu'aw *kalahun*.]

| \text{*}kələhun | kalhun    | kilhun   | 'to reap (PV)'       |

When \*ə in the initial syllable of the root was followed by \*ɹ, its reflex in Matu'uwal is ∅ due to the regular deletion of \*ɹ: Proto-Atayal \*həɹiʔan 'to pour (LV)' > Matu'uwal *hiʔan*, cf. Plngawan *haɹeʔan*. Likewise, \*ə followed by \*q did not surface in suffixed forms in Plngawan: Proto-Atayal \*ləqiŋun 'to hide s.t. (PV)' > Plngawan *lingun*, cf. Matu'uwal *laqingun*.

The verbs 'to accompany' and 'to reap' appear to be exceptions here, in that Plngawan reflects /i/ instead of the regular /a/ in suffixed forms. This is most likely environmentally conditioned, although with only two items, it is difficult to properly generalize the environment.

There are also instances of two dialects agreeing with each other, but disagreeing with the third, for example when Matu'uwal and Matu'aw have the same third-to-last vowel, but Plngawan has a different one. When comparing such evidence, it should be noted that Matu'uwal and Matu'aw are spoken in close geographical proximity, and there is interaction and intermarriage between the two communities. Therefore, a simple majority rule cannot be used here (its use is best eschewed in general), and additional evidence is required.

In @tbl:diff-vowels-pl-a-ml-mw-u-i, Matu'uwal and Matu'aw have the vowel /u/ or /i/, but Plngawan has /a/ in its cognates. Here, we have evidence to reconstruct the vowel in Matu'uwal and Matu'aw to Proto-Atayal.

: Plngawan /a/ vs Matu'uwal and Matu'aw /u/ and /i/ {#tbl:diff-vowels-pl-a-ml-mw-u-i}

| \text{*}ɹimagal | ɹamagal  | ʔimagal   | yimagal | 'five'   |

There are several ways to help us determine the third-to-last vowel in these words. We can use both internal and external evidence: internal evidence comes from female register words in Matu'uwal or other dialects (the gender register system is explained in @sec:gender-register), and external evidence may come from Seediq or from PAn reconstructions (see also @sec:external-evidence-phono).

Here we have internal evidence in the form of female register forms in Matu'uwal: *luhung* 'mortar' and *guquh* 'banana' (both forms are also found in Squliq and Skikun). Both these forms point to a /u/ phoneme in the initial syllable, and based on how the gender register morphology operates (most of the time using right-anchored infixes), we can generally assume the vowel in the initial syllable to remain unchanged. For the numeral 'five', we can look to the related word 'fifty' for evidence: Proto-Atayal \*maɹimal > Plngawan *maɹimal*, Matu'uwal and Matu'aw *maymal*. The numeral fifty shows the vowel /i/ following /ɹ/ in Plngawan, so we can expect the numeral five to share the same vowel, since the two forms share the same root and differ only in affixation.

External evidence corroborates internal evidence here. The female register form *luhung* 'mortar' is descended directly from PAn \*Nusuŋ. The numeral five has a cognate is Seediq *rima*, which comes from PAn \*lima.^[The numerals 2-5 in Atayal were formed using a process very similar to that of male register derivation, and so have additional segments on the right edge or near it.] The vowel in \*guhiluq cannot be supported by internal or external evidence, but is reconstructed here because it follows the same pattern.

In the correspondence set in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a, Matu'uwal has the vowel /i/ where Plngawan and Matu'aw have /a/. These words are disyllabic in Matu'uwal and Plngawan, but were originally trisyllabic in Proto-Atayal (and Matu'aw retained the three-syllable structure). The penultimate vowel in all these words was \*ə, which was regularly deleted in Matu'uwal and Plngawan in this position.

In all words in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a, the vowel in question was followed by \*h or \*ʔ, with a following \*ə. The vowel was either changed in Matu'uwal, or in both Plngawan and Matu'aw.

We know that verbs with \*ə in the initial syllable of the root have /a/ in that position in both Matu'uwal and Plngawan when suffixed (i.e. when \*ə was in the third-to-last syllable). This is also true of verbs with \*-əhə- in the root: Proto-Atayal \*bəhəlan 'to tie (LV)' > Matu'uwal and Plngawan *bahlan*. In other words, \*ə in third-to-last position regularly becomes /a/ in both Matu'uwal and Plngawan. We thus know that the vowel in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a is not \*ə.

Here we can use distribution to help us figure out which dialects changed the vowel. Matu'uwal allows any cardinal vowel to occur in a non-final closed syllable with coda /ʔ/ or /h/: *baʔnux* 'flat', *muhngiq* 'to rest', *mahnuk* 'soft'. On the other hand, in the 2000+ items that I have collected, there is not a single instance of /u/ or /i/ followed by coda /h/ in a penultimate syllable (coda /ʔ/ does not appear word-medially in Plngawan), although there are many examples of such syllables with the vowel /a/, such as those in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a. In Matu'aw, such syllables would not be closed, but would instead be followed by /a/ (< Proto-Atayal \*ə), but it also appears to lack high vowels in this environment. The conclusion here is that Plngawan and Matu'aw neutralized vowel distinctions in the environment \_[hʔ]əCVC, with all vowels in this position becoming /a/.
<!-- TODO: add sound change schema? -->

A similar correspondence can be found in a few other words, shown in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a-extra. Here, the same correspendence of Matu'uwal /i/ with Plngawan and Matu'aw /a/ can be seen, but the environment is different from the one seen in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a.

| \text{*}ɹVlahaŋ | ʔilahang  | ɹahalang | galahang | 'broad'      |
| \text{*}mVŋilis | mingilis  | mangilis | mangilis | 'to cry'     |

In the first two items, the penultimate vowel in Proto-Atayal was \*ə (the penultimate vowel in Plngawan *katuhuɹ* is irregular, cf. Squliq and Skikun *qətəhuy*, C'uli' *təhuy*). This is similar to the data in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a, but the paucity of data prevents me from grouping these two words with the set with the environment \_[hʔ]əCVC. The environment may be broader, but more cognates are needed to say with certainty.

In the final two items, the penultima is a cardinal vowel, so this may be a different pattern (note also the consonant metathesis in Plngawan *ɹahalang*). The verb 'to cry' is highly irregular: the base (negative/imperative AV) is *ʔingilis* in Matu'uwal, but *cangilis* in Plngawan. Additionally, it metathesizes when suffixed: Matu'uwal *lingisan*, Plngawan *cangisan*. In view of an irregular paradigm and irregular correspondences between dialects, this form's reconstruction is uncertain.

There are also several words where /i/ in the third-to-last syllable in Plngawan corresponds to either /u/ or /a/ in Matu'uwal and Matu'aw. These are shown in @tbl:diff-vowels-pl-i-ml-mw-u-a. Most of these lack any supporting evidence to reconstruct the third-to-last vowel.

| \text{*}-bVciyak | mabicek  | sumbaciyak |          | 'to strangle'   |

To reconstruct \*u in \*ruliyug 'point, top', we can use the female register form *rulug* in Matu'uwal. The derivational process here uses the right-anchored infix *-i-*, just like in the pair *luhug\~luhiyug* [@li1983, p. 9]. Likewise for \*səpiyal 'dream', a female register form *səpiʔ* is found in Squliq and Skikun. There is also a PAn reconstruction, but it is ambiguous with regard to the vowel in the initial syllable: \*Sipi/\*Sepi. Apart from that, the Plngawan verb 'to dream' has two pronunciations: *masipel* and *maspel*. Since the vowel /i/ is not normally deleted in penultimate position, the form *maspel* provides additional evidence to reconstruct the vowel \*ə here (whereas *masipel* is likely due to paradigm leveling). Using both the female register form in Squliq and Skikun, as well as the vowel reflexes in Matu'uwal *sapiyal* and Matu'aw *sumapyal* 'to dream' as evidence, the form \*səpiyal 'dream' should be reconstructed for Proto-Atayal.

The other words in @tbl:diff-vowels-pl-i-ml-mw-u-a do not have similar supporting evidence. In this situation, it is best to be overly cautious and not reconstruct specific vowels. However based on the other examples in this section, Matu'uwal preserved vowels in this position most of the time, and Plngawan changed them more often, so I would expect the vowel in Proto-Atayal to be the same as in Matu'uwal and Matu'aw in these words.

### Li's Proto-Atayalic \*-d and \*g' {#sec:irregular-correspondences-proto-atayal}

@li1981 reconstructs the phonology of Proto-Atayalic, and two correspondences in particular will be discussed in this section, because they are directly related to correspondences in Proto-Atayal. These are (1) Li's reconstruction of word-final \*d, discussed in @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d, and (2) Li's reconstruction of \*g', both in word-final position and word-medially, discussed in @sec:li-proto-atayalic-g. In this section I will provide arguments for why there is no evidence for either of these two protophonemes in Atayal, and that they should not be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal, or even Proto-Atayalic.

Readers should pay care to differentiate *Proto-Atayal* and *Proto-Atayalic* in this section. Proto-Atayal is the ancestor of all Atayal dialects, while Proto-Atayalic is the ancestor of Proto-Atayal and Proto-Seediq. In other words, Proto-Atayal is a daughter language of Proto-Atayalic.

#### Li's Proto-Atayalic \*-d {#sec:li-proto-atayalic-d}

Li [-@li1981, p. 254] made note of a correspondence where /ʔ/ in some Atayal dialects (Matu'uwal, Squliq, Skikun) corresponds to /t/ in others (Plngawan, S'uli', C'uli', Matu'aw), and to /c/ in Seediq. This occurs only word-finally. @tbl:gs-t-correspondence shows some examples of this correspondence, of which Li discusses the first four ('feathers', 'leopard', 'ashes', and 'mouse').

The Seediq cognates of the words in Li's list all have final /c/, for example in the Toda dialect: *palic* 'wing', *qolic* 'mouse', *rəkəlic* 'leopard', and *qəbulic* 'ashes'. However, there is no phonemic distinction between word-final /c/ and /t/ in Seediq [@tsukida2005, p. 292;@sung2018, p. 20], and /t/ is affricated word-finally, just like with some Atayal speakers.

Li [-@li1981, p. 255] further suggests that the correspondence should be reconstructed as \*-d in Proto-Atayalic, and supports this claim with the PAn form \*paNid 'wing'. This is problematic, because the Seediq dialects all have the same reflex, whereas Atayal dialects can have either /t/ or /ʔ/ in this correspondence, which would logically require \*-d to also occur in Proto-Atayal. However, **there is no evidence for a \*d phoneme in Proto-Atayal**, since Proto-Atayalic \*d changed to Proto-Atayal \*r: Proto-Atayalic \*dawriq > Proto-Atayal \*rawɹiq 'eyes'.

Careful readers may have noticed that the correspondences in @tbl:gs-t-correspondence occur in a very specific environment, and not just word-finally. With a few exceptions, they are only found in the final syllable *-lit*/*-liʔ*.^[Skikun *kwaniʔ* 'eagle' is likely a sporadic change. Matu'uwal *ʔangriʔ* 'housefly', as well as the unexpected correspondences in 'mouse' and 'to flow' are addressed further in the text.] We can hardly accept a phoneme to occur only in such a specific environment. A more likely scenario is a sound change with existing phonemes.

Another counter-argument to Li's reconstruction of \*d is the behaviour of verbs with this correspondence when suffixed. At least two verbs 'to flow' and 'to peel' can be found with this correspondence, and they both have /c/ in Plngawan when suffixed, as seen in @tbl:gs-t-correspondence-verbs.

: /ʔ/ to /t/ correspondence in verbs {#tbl:gs-t-correspondence-verbs}

| Matu'uwal | Plngawan | Squliq   | C'uli' | Gloss          |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|----------------|
| məqaluwit | mulit    | məqəlwiʔ | məlyut | 'to flow (AV)' |
| qalwicun  | ʔulicun  | qəlyuʔun | lyutun | 'to flow (PV)' |
| qumaliʔ   | ʔumalit  |          |        | 'to peel (AV)' |
| qaliʔun   | ʔalicun  |          |        | 'to peel (PV)' |

Moreover, the verb 'to peel' has a corresponding PAn form \*qaNiC, which has a final \*C, normally reflected as \*c in Proto-Atayal, and as \*t word-finally (see @sec:pan-to-proto-atayal for sound correspondences between PAn and Proto-Atayal). Other verbs with root-final \*C in PAn do not have the change to /ʔ/ in Squliq, Skikun, or Matu'uwal: PAn \*kaRaC 'to bite' > (Proto-Atayal \*kumat\~kacun) > Matu'uwal *kumat\~kacun*, Squliq and Skikun *kəmat\~katun*. This demonstrates that the correspondence of /t/ to /ʔ/ is not due to regular reflexes of a specific protophoneme that only occurs in this position, but is rather environmentally conditioned.

Matu'uwal *qumaliʔ\~qaliʔun* 'to peel' was regularized in its suffixed forms, as this correspondence is otherwise limited to word-final position. Likewise, Squliq *məqəlwiʔ\~qəlyuʔun* 'to flow' underwent regularization, and apparently late enough that its PV form does not exhibit vowel coalescence: the form is *qəlyuʔun* instead of the expected \*\*qəlyun. Note that Matu'uwal has a final /t\~c/ in this root. In Matu'uwal, final /ʔ/ to Plngawan /t/ only appears in the syllable *-liʔ*, or in one case, *-riʔ* (discussed below). Squliq extends the environment to include the syllable *-lwiʔ*, as in *məqəlwiʔ* 'to flow' or *təlwiʔ* 'mulberry'.^[The Squliq and Skikun *təlwiʔ* 'mulberry' has cognates in Seediq *tədiyuc*. C'uli' *təluy* appears to be a loan from Squliq based on the sound correspondences.]

@tbl:gs-t-correspondence includes the Matu'uwal form *ʔangriʔ* (or *wangriʔ*, see correspondences of \*ɹ in @sec:consonant-correspondences). This form appears distinct from the other correspondences in the table for having an /r/ onset instead of an /l/ in the final syllable, but only in Matu'uwal. Seediq agrees with Matu'uwal here, having *rəngədi* or *rəngəji* (with /d/ affrication before the vowel /i/), depending on the dialect. More importantly, Seediq does not have final /c/ in this word, but it does have it in all other words in this correspondence set. My explanation is that this word did not originally belong in the same set, but was later added to it by receiving the derivational suffix *-lit* in Plngawan, Squliq, and Skikun (C'uli', S'uli', and Matu'aw have a different suffix in this word). I explain the derivational aspect of this correspondence at the end of this section.

Another word, 'mouse', has unexpected reflexes in Matu'uwal and Skikun: Matu'uwal *qawlit* and Skikun *qolit* (alongside variant pronunciation *qoliʔ*). Either this word somehow resisted the sound change that occurred everywhere else in the set, or it was reborrowed from another dialect. It is difficult to judge what exactly happened here, although a borrowing scenario appears unlikely, since no other dialects preserved both initial /q/ and final /t/ in this word.

If this is a sound change, what was the phoneme initially? Was it preserved in any of the dialects? Which dialects changed the words in this set, and which ones did not? Here we may once again look to phonotactics and phoneme distribution for answers. Matu'uwal, Squluq, and Skikun do not allow the syllable *-lit* to occur word-finally (with the exception of the aforementioned word 'mouse'). On the other hand, the remaining dialects allow both *-lit* and *-liʔ* to occur in word-final position. @tbl:final-li shows a few instances of word-final *-liʔ* occurring in cognates across the Atayal dialects.

: Final *-liʔ* correspondence across Atayal dialects {#tbl:final-li}

| Matu'uwal | Squliq  | Plngawan | C'uli' | Gloss           |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| sumliʔ    | səməliʔ | sunliʔ   | səməli | 'to collect'    |
| buliʔ     | buliʔ   | buliʔ    |        | 'small knife'   |
|           | ʔaliʔ   | ʔaliʔ    | ʔaliʔ  | 'bamboo shoots' |

Since Plngawan, C'uli, S'uli', and Matu'aw distinguish word-final *-liʔ* from *-lit*, while Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun do not, then the former must have preserved the distinction, while the latter merged the two syllables together.

Why this specific syllable? One possibility is that this syllable was a derivational suffix for male register forms (@sec:gender-register presents an overview of the gender register system). We can see the affix in words like Matu'uwal *qabuliʔ* 'ashes' and Squliq *həmaliʔ* 'tongue' when we compare them with PAn forms \*qabu 'ashes' and \*Sema 'tongue' (Matu'uwal has *həmaʔ* 'tongue'). The original suffix \*-lit must have been replaced with *-liʔ* in Squliq, Skikun, and Matu'uwal, and this replacement then triggered an analogical change even in words where /lit/ was part of the root, as in Matu'uwal *qumaliʔ* 'to peel', cf. Plngawan *ʔumalit*, PAn \*qaNiC.

Thus these words would have originally ended in \*-lit, and were only changed in Squliq, Skikun, and Matu'uwal. This also agrees with the evidence in Seediq, where cognates all have a final /c/ (< \*-t).

#### Li's Proto-Atayalic \*g' {#sec:li-proto-atayalic-g}

Li reconstructs a phoneme \*g' in Proto-Atayalic to account for three sets of correspondences. These are reproduced in @tbl:li-g-prime-correspondences with minor corrections.

: Li's \*g' correspondences [from @li1981, pp. 258-259] {#tbl:li-g-prime-correspondences}

| Skikun  | Matu'uwal  | Inago Seediq | Gloss                    |
|---------|------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| pisaʔ   | (piyaʔ)    | piyaʔ        | 'how many'               |
| kisaʔ   | kisaʔ      | kiyaʔ        | 'soon, later'            |
| bəgisaʔ | bagisaʔ    | bəgiyaʔ      | 'reed of loom'           |
| cəhisaʔ | cu hisaʔ   | sigaʔ        | 'yesterday'              |
| kəgis   | kəgiy      | kərig        | 'hemp, ramie'            |
| kəgis-i | kumkagis-i |              | 'to strip hemp (PV.imp)' |
| mes     | mabaiy     | marig        | 'to buy (AV)'            |
| bes-un  | bays-un    | bərig-i      | 'to buy (PV)'            |

The first set Li identified are word-medial correspondences between /s/ in Atayal and /y/ in Seediq, specifically between the vowels i\_a (except in the word 'yesterday'). The second are word-medial correspondences of /s/ in Atayal and /g/ in Seediq between other vowels. The third set are word-final correspondences of /y/ in Atayal except Skikun, /s/ in Skikun, and /g/ or /y/ in Seediq, depending on the dialect.

If we start with word-final correspondences, we see the following pattern: they always occur following the vowel /i/, and all of Li's examples are in verbs with consonantal alternations in Atayal. Here, Li uses Skikun as crucial evidence to reconstruct this protophoneme. However, as explained in @sec:paradigm-leveling, **Skikun has a very strong tendency to level out consonant alternations in verbal paradigms**. Li's correspondences of Proto-Atayalic \*g in final position after \*i are identical to those of \*g', except for the Skikun reflex, but all the correspondences of \*g are found in nominal roots, i.e. roots that do not take suffixes, for example \*bunaqig 'sand'.

In other words, what Li saw as a reflex of a unique protophoneme is in fact an artefact of paradigm leveling in alternating roots in Skikun. When this paradigm leveling in verbal roots is taken into account, Li's \*g and \*g' are in complementary distribution with each other, since \*g' is only ever found after \*i. Reconstructing two phonemes here is superfluous.

For Proto-Atayal, this means that no additional protophonemes need to be proposed in this case, as the correspondences are adequately explained as regular reflexes of \*-s- and \*-g, with later paradigm leveling in Skikun. The alternating consonants in these verbal roots have to be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal.

## Proto-Atayal phoneme inventory {#sec:proto-atayal-phoneme-inventory}

With the individual sound correspondences in @sec:sound-correspondences completed, they can now be unified into a table showing the full phoneme inventory of Proto-Atayal. @tbl:proto-atayal-consonants displays all the consonant phonemes that can be reconstructed for Proto-Atayal.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Proto-Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:proto-atayal-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p & t    & k & q & ʔ \\
b &      & g &   &   \\
  & c    &   &   &   \\
  & s    & x & h &   \\
m & n    & ŋ &   &   \\
  & l, r &   &   &   \\
w & y, ɹ &   &   &   \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Proto-Atayal had more phonemic distinctions than any of the extant Atayal dialects, which underwent various mergers but almost no splits in their consonants (with the possible exception of Squliq /z/). There was a gap in voiced plosives, since Proto-Atayal, like all Atayal dialects, lacked a /d/ phoneme: Proto-Atayalic \*d had changed to Proto-Atayal \*r, but not before Proto-Atayalic \*r had changed to Proto-Atayal \*ɹ, thereby avoiding a merger.

There were thus two rhotics in Proto-Atayal: \*r and \*ɹ. We can determine the fact that \*ɹ was an approximant from its reflexes. Most importantly, Plngawan still reflects it as a separate phoneme /ɹ/. Other dialects merge it with /w/ or /y/ where it is not deleted, the common feature being that /w/ and /y/ are both approximants. On the other hand, Proto-Atayal \*r is still regularly reflected as /r/ in all dialects (except for instances of assimilation or neutralization in specific environments).

Proto-Atayal \*b was most likely a plosive, though it may have had fricative allophones in certain positions, especially intervocalically. Not only can it still be realized as a plosive [b] in Plngawan, C'uli', and Skikun ([@sec:plngawan-consonants;@sec:culi-consonants;@sec:skikun-consonants]), but when it was devoiced word-finally in all dialects except Matu'uwal, it became /p/ and not /f/.

By analogy with \*b, we might assume that \*g was also plosive, and that was likely the case word-initially, to judge from Plngawan reflexes. Word-final \*g must have lenited earlier than \*b, because it did not merge with the voiceless velar plosive /k/ in any dialect, but instead variously with /x/, /w/, or ∅.

The vowel system of Proto-Atayal was quite simple, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-vowels. The main difference between Proto-Atayal and modern dialects is the complete lack of mid vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Proto-Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:proto-atayal-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &      & u     \\
      & ə    &       \\
      & a    &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Proto-Atayal \*ə was limited to non-final syllables, whereas the remaining three vowels could occur in any syllable. There were also three "diphthongs" (VG sequences): \*aw, \*ay, and \*uy.

## Proto-Atayal phonotactics {#sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics}

Most phonemes in Proto-Atayal could occur in any position within the word, including word-finally. The voiceless velar fricative \*x was found in word-inital position in only a single word, \*xuɹil 'dog'. The vowel \*ə could not appear in the final syllable, but was allowed elsewhere: \*bəhut 'squirrel', \*kələhun 'to reap, to harvest (PV)'.

The affricate \*c could not appear word-finally, and instead changed to \*t. Some speakers pronounce word-final /t/ as an affricate [ts], however this is not a reflex of word-final \*c: in S'uli' and Matu'uwal, which merge \*c and \*s into /s/, none of these final segments are reflected as /s/, and are all /t/, pronounced either [t] or [ts].

The syllable structure of Proto-Atayal was quite simple, with only CV and CVC syllables allowed. CVC syllables could only be word-final, except if the coda was a glide (CVG), in which case they could appear word-medially. Examples for each syllable type are given in @tbl:proto-atayal-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in Proto-Atayal {#tbl:proto-atayal-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example       | Gloss      |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| CV            | \***ba**gah   | 'charcoal' |
| CVG           | \***raw**ɹiq  | 'eyes'     |
| CVC           | \*hapu**niq** | 'fire'     |

<!-- Sed diyax 'day', swayi 'younger sibling', mkuung 'dark' -->
It generally seems that in content words, the final syllable was obligatorily closed. This was not necessarily the case for function words: \*cimu 'you (2PL.Nom)', \*ʔuɹi 'too, also', \*haca 'that'. However the verb \*mahi 'to hit' is an apparent counterexample to this tendency, and the lack of any root-final consonant can be seen in the PV form \*bahiyun. The imperative/negative PV/LV suffix \*-i likewise did not have a final consonant (see @sec:voice-system for a detailed description of the Proto-Atayal voice morphology).

Unlike its daughter language Matu'uwal, Proto-Atayal did not have a distinction between hiatuses (VV) and vowels with an intervening glottal stop (VʔV). This distinction arose in Matu'uwal after the deletion of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ. The glottal stop is preserved in Matu'uwal when (1) the two vowels were identical, as in *matbabaʔang* 'crooked' or *mənakuʔum* 'dark'; (2) when the first vowel was high and the second was low, as in *riʔax* 'day' or *ciʔax* 'light'; or (3) when the first vowel was a \*ə in Proto-Atayal, as in *masʔang* 'to scold' (< \*masəʔaŋ). Other dialects only preserved glottal stops in the third environment, and sporadically elsewhere. Matu'uwal does not preserve root-internal glottal stops in the fourth environment---a low vowel followed by a high vowel---except in a single word *raʔung* 'hook' and its derivatives, though verbs ending with /-aʔ/ always retain the glottal stop when suffixed, e.g. *gibaʔun* 'to hug, to embrace (PV)'. The Matu'uwal words *cumaʔing* 'to sew' and *sumaʔing* 'to reap' (and derivatives) appear to be exceptions, too, however these are male register form of the verbs *cumaqis* and *sumaqit*, respectively. No other dialect has these male register forms, so they must have been innovated in Matu'uwal after the loss of \*ʔ in the environment a\_i, thus creating a new contrast where it previously did not exist (see @sec:gender-register for an explanation of the gender register system in Atayal).

If we take Matu'uwal reflexes to be the same as the original Proto-Atayal^[Here we use Matu'uwal because all the other dialects deleted glottal stops in many environments where Matu'uwal did not.], then we would have a phonotactically imbalanced system, where hiatuses were allowed to occur only between a low vowel and a high vowel, and only inside a root. This would make them have a complementary distribution with VʔV sequences. It makes more sense to reconstruct a phonemic glottal stop between all adjacent vowels, since there is no evidence for reconstructing phonemically distinct VV and VʔV sequences. That being said, the actual pronunciation of glottal stops in this position likely varied, and may have been optional (due to the lack of a phonemic contrast with true vowel clusters), like it is in Plngawan or C'uli'. Reconstructing glottal stops between adjacent vowels helps distinguish such sequences from vowels with an intervening glide. See @tbl:ia-iya-contrast for a comparison between Matu'uwal, which preserves the distinction between intervocalic glottal stops from glides, and Squliq and Skikun, which no longer contrast the two.

: Contrast between /iʔa/ and /iya/ in Atayal {#tbl:ia-iya-contrast}

| Proto-Atayal  | Matu'uwal | Squliq | Skikun | Gloss       |
|---------------|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| \text{*}ciʔax | ciʔax     | syax   | cyax   | 'light'     |
| \text{*}siyag | siyag     | syaw   | syax   | 'edge, rim' |

Proto-Atayal did not allow CG sequences. Instead, whenever we see such a sequence in a modern Atayal dialect, Proto-Atayal had a vowel between the two, homorganic with the glide. The evidence for this comes from Matu'uwal, which still preserves these vowels, from Plngawan reflexes of such vowels after \*q (where two vowels surface), and from Seediq, where not only are these vowels present, but they receive stress (stress in Seediq is penultimate): Proto-Atayal \*quwalax 'rain' > Matu'uwal *quwalax*, Plngawan *ʔawalax*, and Proto-Atayal \*ŋaquwaq 'mouth' > Matu'uwal *ngaquwaq*, Plngawan *ngawaʔ*, cf. Seediq *quwaq* [ˈqu.waq].

The "diphthongs" (VG sequences) \*aw and \*ay could occur in non-final syllables: \*rawɹiq 'eyes', \*wayluŋ 'chicken'. There are no instances of non-final \*uy in my data, though it is unclear if this was a phonotactic restriction, an accidental gap, or if my data is insufficient.

Stress in Proto-Atayal was fixed and word-final, like in all seven dialects under consideration.

## External evidence {#sec:external-evidence-phono}

Apart from internal evidence, i.e. Atayal reflexes, we can also utilize external evidence to corroborate our findings and make reconstructions more precise. Here I divide external evidence into two sources: Seediq and Proto-Austronesian.

Seediq is the most closely related language to Atayal, and the two share phonological and lexical innovations that cannot be found elsewhere. This makes Seediq an excellent source of additional evidence.

Proto-Austronesian is reconstructed based on evidence in many Austronesian languages, both in Taiwan and outside it (through the Malayo-Polynesian branch). It gives us a chronologically deep look into the workings of the family, but can help with some phonemes in Proto-Atayal specifically.

### Evidence from Seediq {#sec:evidence-from-seediq-phono}

Seediq provides supporting evidence for the syllabic structure described in @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics, namely disyllabic CVGVC sequences in such words as Proto-Atayal \*ŋaquwaq 'mouth', \*kuwiʔ 'insect', \*cumiyuk 'to answer, to respond', as opposed to reconstructing CGVC monosyllables. Stress in Seediq is penultimate [@tsukida2005, p. 293], thus the cognates of the aforementioned words are pronounced [ˈqu.waq] 'mouth', [ˈku.wi] 'insect', and [cə.ˈmi.yuk] 'to answer', respectively. The vowel preceding its homorganic glide receives stress in Seediq, which adds weight to evidence from Matu'uwal that a phonemic vowel was indeed present there in Proto-Atayal.

Seediq also supports reconstructing a \*ə vowel in Proto-Atayal, again thanks to its penultimate stress. The distribution of vowels in Seediq is the same as in Atayal, i.e. schwa does not appear in the final syllable, however penultimale schwa can receive stress [@tsukida2005, pp. 292-293]. This stressed schwa is generally regarded as phonemic. The presence of \*ə in Proto-Atayal is doubtless, due to the various reflexes in its daughter languages, though its phonemic status may be disputed.

Seediq can be used to support the reconstruction of certain phonemes, especially in etyma with insufficient internal evidence. In words without Plngawan reflexes, Seediq cognates can help identify the presence of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ (which corresponds to Seediq /r/), for example in \*paɹih 'hoe' and \*kumaɹiʔ 'to dig', cf. Seediq *parih* and *kəmari*, respectively (Truku dialect).

Another correspondence where Seediq is helpful is word-final \*-ig. No Atayal dialect preserves final \*g in this environment, however we do know that it existed in Proto-Atayal, based on Paul Li's notes on Matu'aw circa 1980, when it was still preserved by older speakers [@li1980;@li1981;@li1982b]. At the same time, not all instances of word-final long /iː/ can automatically be reconstructed as \*-ig (see discussion on \*mahi\~bahiyun in @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics). Several dialects of Seediq preserve a final /g/ or /r/ in these words, compare Proto-Atayal \*wahig 'vine' and Truku *wahir*, Proto-Atayal \*mabaɹig 'to buy' and Seediq *marig*, Proto-Atayal \*kəgig 'hemp, ramie' and Truku *kərig*.

I also used Seediq evidence to reconstruct word-final \*-lit in words with final /t/ in some dialects corresponding to /ʔ/ in others. Differences in the distribution of phonemes between Atayal dialects led me to reconstruct \*-t in Proto-Atayal, and Seediq cognates support that conclusion. See @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d for an in-depth explanation.

### Evidence from PAn reconstructions {#sec:evidence-from-pan-phono}

There are relatively few Proto-Austronesian etyma with reflexes in Atayal, and they rarely provide crucial evidence for reconstructing phonemes (they are more useful in determining lexical retentions, see @sec:evidence-from-pan-lexical). However, they can still serve as additional evidence for Proto-Atayal reconstructions. At the same time, care should be taken not to give too much weight to Proto-Austronesian reconstructions at the expense of internal evidence from Atayal.

In @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d I used PAn \*qaNiC 'skin, hide' as evidence against Li's argument for reconstructing \*d in Proto-Atayalic for words that variously have a reflex of /t/ or /ʔ/ in word-final position in different Atayal dialects. Li originally used the PAn etymon \*paNid 'wing' to argue that the origin of these reflexes was a voiced plosive that was lost in all dialects of Atayal and Seediq. PAn \*qaNiC 'skin, hide' supports an alternative hypothesis that the reflexes do not come from a unique phoneme, and are instead environmentally conditioned. See @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d for full discussion.

Proto-Austronesian \*l is reflected in Proto-Atayal as \*ɹ, for example PAn \*walay 'yarn' > Proto-Atayal \*waɹay. PAn protoforms can be used to reconstruct \*ɹ in Proto-Atayal in cases where internal evidence is insufficient, as in PAn \*Cali 'taro' > Proto-Atayal \*caɹiʔ, of which the only remaining reflex is Matu'uwal *caiʔ* (the other dialects all use a different form).

PAn etyma may provide additional evidence for reconstructing vowels, especially \*ə: PAn \*telu 'three' > Proto-Atayal \*təɹugal, with an additional suffix *-gal*, cf. also Proto-Atayal \*matəɹuʔ 'six' and \*matəɹul 'thirty'. They may also be used when reconstructing vowels in the third-to-last syllable, as in PAn \*qaSelu 'pestle' > Proto-Atayal \*qaseɹuʔ, or PAn \*qaRidaŋ 'beans, peas' > Proto-Atayal \*qagiraŋ 'cowpeas'. See [@sec:vowel-correspondences;@sec:prepenult-vowel-correspondences] for more information on reconstructing vowels.

Proto-Austronesian reconstructions can also help identify irregular correspondences in Atayal dialects. For example, PAn \*N is regularly reflected as Proto-Atayal \*l, so the correspondence of PAn \*wanaN 'right hand side' is regular in Plngawan and Matu'aw *ʔanaliʔ* (with an additional suffix *-iʔ*), but irregular in Matu'uwal *ʔanan*. Likewise, PAn \*C > Proto-Atayal \*c, so PAn \*baCaR 'proso millet' is regularly reflected in Skikun *bacyax*^[Some words in Skikun, S'uli', and C'uli' have sporadic palatalization that most commonly affects the phonemes /s/ and /c/.] and S'uli' *basaw*, while Matu'uwal *basag* is irregular. Regular correspondences of PAn protophonemes to Proto-Atayal are listed in @sec:pan-to-proto-atayal.
<!-- TODO: talk about sporadic palatalization somewhere? -->

## Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Atayal dialects {#sec:proto-atayal-to-dialects}

This section lists all regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to each of the seven dialects under study. Chronological relationships between sound changes in the same dialect are given where applicable. Changes that only affect some speakers of a dialect, and sporadically recurring changes (i.e. non-systematic changes that occur in more than a single word), are mentioned separately.

The same sound change may occur in different dialects, but that does not necessarily mean that it is a shared innovation. Instead, we can prove that at least some of these identical sound changes happened independently. See @sec:phonological-evidence for more details.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Squliq {#sec:proto-atayal-to-sq}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Squliq can be indentified:

1. **\*c, \*s > s.** The affricate \*c fully and unconditionally merged into \*s: Proto-Atayal \*cumaqis 'to sew' > Squliq *səmaqis*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Squliq *bisuw*.
2. **\*ɹ, \*y > y.** The retroflex approximant \*ɹ fully and unconditionally merged into \*y: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Squliq *yungay*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > Squliq *wayay*, Proto-Atayal \*malikuɹ 'man, husband' > Squliq *məlikuy*.
3. **\*t > c /\_i,y.** The coronal plosive \*t was affricated before the high front vowel or its corresponding glide: Proto-Atayal \*timuʔ 'salt' > Squliq *cimuʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*taɹasiʔ 'straw hat' > Squliq *cyasiʔ*. Strictly speaking, this \<c\> is an allophone of /t/ in this position, but this change is useful in determining the relative chronology of other sound changes, see below.
4. **Vowel lenition.** Vowels outside the rightmost foot, i.e. third-to-last syllable and beyond, were lenited into /ə/: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Squliq *kəneril*, Proto-Atayal *turakis* 'foxtail millet' > Squliq *tərakis*, Proto-Atayal *pisaniq* 'taboo' > Squliq *pəsaniq*. This did not affect some words with \*ay in the third-to-last syllable, namely  Proto-Atayal \*baytaqan 'to stab (PV)' > Squliq *betaqan*, Proto-Atayal \*-baytunux 'beautiful' > Squliq *betunux*, and maybe Proto-Atayal \*bVʔənux > Squliq *beʔənux* (though the vowel in the last etymon is uncertain). However, in other cases Squliq did not preserve \*ay in the same environment: Proto-Atayal \*tayhəkan 'to arrive (LV)' > Squliq *təhəkan*, Proto-Atayal \*qayqayaʔ 'thing' > Squliq *qəqayaʔ* (cf. Plngawan *ʔayʔayaʔ*, Skikun *qeqayaʔ*).

   Note that in the AV infix *-əm-* and AV prefix *mə-* the vowel is lenited even if it falls on the penultimate syllable. The voice morphology is discussed in @sec:voice-system.
5. **Vowel coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \*mVnakuʔum 'dark' > Squliq *mənəkum*. When the penultima was a low vowel \*a, and the ultima a high vowel, they merged into a mid vowel: Proto-Atayal \*-raʔuŋ 'hook (for hanging things)' > Squliq *kərong*, Proto-Atayal \*baʔis 'partner, spouse' > Squliq *bes*. When the penultima was a high vowel an the ultima a low vowel, the high vowel became a glide and the two syllables merged into a single CGVC syllable: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > Squliq *ryax*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.

   This process was combined with the **monophthongization of offglides** in the penultima. The offglides \*aw and \*ay were monophthongized into mid vowels, but only in the penultimate syllable: Proto-Atayal \*tawkan 'net bag carried on back' > Squliq *tokan*, Proto-Atayal \*haylag 'fast' > Squliq *helaw*.
6. **\*g > w /a\_#; > ∅ /V\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final \*-g was changed in one of two ways in Squliq, depending on the preceding vowel. When preceded by \*a, it merged with \*w: Proto-Atayal \*ʔurag 'dirt' > Squliq *ʔuraw*. When preceded by a high vowel, it was deleted, and the vowel was lengthened: Proto-Atayal \*kəgig 'hemp, ramie' > Squliq *kəgiy*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Squliq *bisuw*.
7. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced into /p/ in word-final position in Squliq: Proto-Atayal \*humab 'to stab, to spear' > Squliq *həmap*. In verbal roots, it can be seen after suffixation, see @sec:final-devoicing for more details.
8. **Rhotacism: \*s > r /i\_V́.** Proto-Atayal \*s becomes /r/ in Squliq under very specific conditions: only when it is preceded by \*i and followed by a stressed vowel (i.e. final vowel). For example, Proto-Atayal \*pisaʔ 'how many' > Squliq *piraʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*ʔisah 'older brother's wife' > Squliq *ʔirah*.

   If the vowel preceding \*s is anything other than \*i, rhotacism does not occur, e.g. Proto-Atayal \*musaʔ 'to go (AV)' > Squliq *musaʔ*. Rhotacism is also blocked if \*s does not immediately precede stress: Proto-Atayal \*pisaniq 'taboo' > Squliq *pəsaniq*.
9. **Liquid assimilation.** When a Proto-Atayal word had an onset \*r followed by an onset \*l, the first \*r became /l/ in Squliq: Proto-Atayal \*raluʔ 'name' > Squliq *laluʔ*. This rule was not applied when the second liquid was in coda position, either in the same syllable or in a different one: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Squliq *kəneril*, Proto-Atayal \*rapal 'sole (of foot)' > Squliq *rapal*.
10. **Dorsal harmony.** Proto-Atayal \*k became /q/ in Squliq if it was followed by \*q anywhere in the world, and sometimes when followed by \*h. The harmony with \*q was exceptionless, according to my data: Proto-Atayal \*-kuriq 'to steal' > Squliq *məquriq* (cf. C'uli' *məkuri*), Proto-Atayal \*kisəliq 'to love, to like' > Squliq *qəsəliq* (cf. Matu'uwal *kisliq*). When followed by \*h, \*k was backed in some words, but not others: Proto-Atayal \*kVtəhuɹ 'fat, stout' > Squliq *qətəhuy*, Proto-Atayal \*kahuy 'tree' > Squliq *qahuy* 'firewood', Proto-Atayal \*kumayhuɹ 'to dig' > Squliq *qəmihuy*, but Proto-Atayal \*kuhiŋ 'head louse' > Squliq *kuhing*, Proto-Atayal \*kəhuʔ 'granary' > Squliq *kəhuʔ*. Proto-Atayal \*k may also be sporadically backed into /q/ without any conditioning environment, see below for some examples.
11. **\*-lit > -liʔ.** In this very specific sound change, the Proto-Atayal final syllables \*-lit and \*-liʔ were merged into *-liʔ* in Squliq: Proto-Atayal \*qabulit 'ashes' > Squliq *qəbuliʔ*, cf. Plngawan *ʔabulit*. See @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d for a detailed explanation.
12. **Fortition of \*w before schwa.** In trisyllabic words where the first syllable began with \*w, it was fortitioned into a fricative: Proto-Atayal \*waqanux 'sambar deer' > Squliq *bəqanux*, Proto-Atayal \*waciluŋ 'pond, lake' > Squliq *bəsilung*, Proto-Atayal \*wariyuŋ 'neck' > Squliq *gəryung*. This was likely a repair strategy to avoid an illegal /wə/ sequence. The choice between /b/ and /g/ is unclear, as the aforementioned three lexical items are the only examples of this change.

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the above sound changes:

- 1 > 3 (merger of \*c and \*s preceded affrication of \*t): Proto-Atayal \*timuʔ 'salt' > Squliq *cimuʔ* instead of \*\*simuʔ.
- 2 > 3 (merger of \*ɹ and \*y preceded affrication of \*t): Proto-Atayal \*təɹugal 'three' > Squliq *cyugal* instead of \*\*tyugal (cf. Skikun *tyugal*).
- 4 > 5 (vowel lenition preceded vowel coalescence): Proto-Atayal \*mVnakuʔum 'dark' > Squliq *mənəkum* instead of \*\*mənakum.
- 8 > 1 (rhotacism preceded merger of \*c and \*s): Proto-Atayal \*bicug > Squliq *bisuw* instead of \*\*biruw.
- 4 > 12 (vowel lenition preceded \*w fortition): Proto-Atayal \*waqanux > Squliq *bəqanux* instead of \*\*wəqanux.

Apart from the regular sound changes described above, other changes in Squliq may be identified, but may be limited to certain speakers, or else sporadic:

- Word-final \*l may be merged into /n/, especially by younger speakers.
- Proto-Atayal \*k may be backed into /q/ sporadically and without any conditioning factors: Proto-Atayal \*kuwalit 'eagle' > Squliq *qwaliʔ*. More prominently, this happened in the nominal case markers and qeictics of Squliq: compare Squliq *qu* and Matu'uwal *ku*, both nominative case markers; or Squliq *qani* 'this' and *qasa* 'that' with Plngawan *kani* 'this' and *kaca* 'that'.
- The glide /y/ has a fricative allophone [ʑ] that may be analyzed as a marginal phoneme in some varieties of Squliq, but not in others [@huang2015a].
- In parallel with /y/, /w/ may also be optionally fortitioned into /g/ even when followed by cardinal vowels. This gives rise to variant forms such as *wagiʔ* and *gwagiʔ* 'Sun' (< Proto-Atayal \*wagiʔ), or *wagiq* and *gwagiq* 'tall' (< Proto-Atayal \*bawiq). Due to the optional nature and limited distribution of this change, it is likely more recent than /y/ allophony.
- Some apparently irregular correspondences may also be explained through the regularization of irregular verbal paradigms. This is discussed in detail in @sec:paradigm-leveling.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to S'uli' {#sec:proto-atayal-to-su}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to S'uli' can be indentified:

1. **\*c, \*s > s.** The affricate \*c fully and unconditionally merged into \*s: Proto-Atayal \*cumiyuk 'to reply, to answer' > S'uli' *səmyuk*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > S'uli' *bisuw*.
2. **\*q, \*ʔ > ʔ.** Proto-Atayal \*q merged into the glottal stop /ʔ/ in S'uli': Proto-Atayal \*qawlit 'mouse' > S'uli' *ʔolit*, Proto-Atayal \*taquɹ 'crow' > S'uli' *taʔuy*.
3. **\*ɹ, \*y > y.** The retroflex approximant \*ɹ fully and unconditionally merged into \*y: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > S'uli' *yungay*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > S'uli' *wayay*, Proto-Atayal \*qihuɹ 'horn' > S'uli' *ʔihuy*.
4. **\*l, \*n > n /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*l merges with \*n word-finally: Proto-Atayal \*xuɹil 'dog' > S'uli' *huzin*. Unlike other dialects, where this merger is mostly limited to younger, more innovative speakers, this sound change is S'uli' appears complete.
5. **Vowel lenition.** Vowels outside the rightmost foot, i.e. third-to-last syllable and beyond, were lenited into /ə/: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > S'uli' *kənerin*, Proto-Atayal *turakis* 'foxtail millet' > S'uli' *tərakis*, Proto-Atayal *pisaniq* 'taboo' > S'uli' *pəsani*. The apparent exception *betunux* 'pretty, beautiful' (< Proto-Atayal \*-baytunux) may be due to influence from Squliq.

   Note that in the AV infix *-əm-* and AV prefix *mə-* the vowel is lenited even if it falls on the penultimate syllable. The voice morphology is discussed in @sec:voice-system.
6. **Vowel coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \*biʔiŋ 'to hold in hand' > S'uli' *bing*.^[S'uli' *məkuʔum* 'dark' (< Proto-Atayal \*mVnakuʔum) is an exception to this rule.] When the penultima was a high vowel an the ultima a low vowel, the high vowel became a glide and the two syllables merged into a single CGVC syllable: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > S'uli' *ryax*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.
   
   When the penultima was a low vowel \*a, and the ultima a high vowel, the two syllables first merged into a single syllable with an offglide. This offglide was later monophthongized into mid vowels (rule 11), but not before the deletion of final glottal stops (rule 10). Thus we see Proto-Atayal \*raʔum 'needle' > S'uli' *rom*, Proto-Atayal \*baʔis 'partner, spouse' > S'uli' *bes*, but Proto-Atayal \*suwaʔiʔ 'younger sibling' > S'uli' *sway*.
7. **\*g > w /a\_#; > ∅ /V\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final \*-g was changed in one of two ways in S'uli', depending on the preceding vowel. When preceded by \*a, it merged with \*w: Proto-Atayal \*siyag 'edge, rim' > S'uli' *syaw*. When preceded by a high vowel, it was deleted: Proto-Atayal \*kəgig 'hemp, ramie' > S'uli' *kəgi*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > S'uli' *bisu*.
8. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced into /p/ in word-final position in S'uli': Proto-Atayal \*masuɹab 'to yawn' > S'uli' *məsuyap*. In verbal roots, it can be seen after suffixation, see @sec:final-devoicing for more details.
9. **Liquid assimilation.** When a Proto-Atayal word had an onset \*r followed by an onset \*l, the first \*r became /l/ in S'uli': Proto-Atayal \*raluʔ 'name' > S'uli' *lalu*. This rule was not applied when the second liquid was in coda position, either in the same syllable or in a different one (although in S'uli' \*l > n word-finally, see rule 4): Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > S'uli' *kənerin*, Proto-Atayal \*masiraŋil > S'uli' *məsərangin*.
10. **\*ʔ > ∅ /\_#.** Glottal stops were lost in word-final position in S'uli': Proto-Atayal \*kəhuʔ 'granary' > S'uli' *kəhu* (see also @sec:suli-phonotactics). This influenced vowel coalescence, so that vowel sequences preceding a final glottal stop did not coalesce, but instead remained as offlides: Proto-Atayal \*suwaʔiʔ 'younger sibling' > S'uli' *sway* (cf. Squliq *səsweʔ*, C'uli' *səswe*). This also affected words with final \*q in Proto-Atayal: Proto-Atayal \*raraʔuq 'low, short' > S'uli' *rəraw* (cf. Squliq *rəroq*, C'uli' *rərow*).
<!-- TODO: I can't name a dialect S'uli' or C'uli' and then say that it lost glottal stops -->
11. **Monophthongization of offglides.** The offglides \*aw and \*ay were monophthongized into mid vowels, unless they were word-final: Proto-Atayal \*rawɹiq 'eyes' > S'uli' *rozi*, Proto-Atayal \*haylag 'fast' > S'uli' *helaw*.

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the sound changes in S'uli':

- 5 > 6 (vowel lenition preceded vowel coalescence): Proto-Atayal \*galaʔiŋ 'front' > S'uli' *gəleng* instead of \*\*galeng.
- 6 > 2 (vowel coalescence preceded \*q > ʔ): Proto-Atayal \*baqun 'to know (PV) > S'uli' *baʔun* instead of \*\*bon.
- 2 > 10 (\*q > ʔ preceded loss of final glottal stops): Proto-Atayal \*raraʔuq 'low, short' > S'uli' *rəraw* instead of \*\*rəroʔ.
- 10 > 11 (loss of final glottal stops preceded the monophthongization of offglides): Proto-Atayal \*suwaʔiʔ 'younger sibling' > S'uli' *sway* instead of \*\*swe.

Some phonological phenomena that do not qualify as systematic sound changes include:

- The central vowel /ə/ may be lowered to /a/ and merge with it completely in the speech of some speakers.
- The palatal glide /y/ has a fricative allophone [ʑ] before the vowel /i/. Its distribution is more limited than the similar allophone in Squliq.
- The sound change **t > c /\_i** seemingly appears in some words, but not others, and sometimes two variants of a single word may be accepted, e.g. *tugan* or *cyugan* 'three', *byating* or *byacing* 'moon'. Since the data does not show a systematic change (and moreover there are even competing variants), the affrication is most likely due to influence from Squliq.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Skikun {#sec:proto-atayal-to-sk}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Skikun can be indentified:

1. **\*ɹ, \*y > y.** The retroflex approximant \*ɹ fully and unconditionally merged into \*y: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Skikun *yungay*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > Skikun *wayay*, Proto-Atayal \*malikuɹ 'man, husband' > Skikun *məlikuy*.
2. **\*t > c /\_i.** The coronal plosive \*t was affricated before the high front vowel or its corresponding glide: Proto-Atayal \*timuʔ 'salt' > Skikun *cimuʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*qalətiŋ 'wooden plank' > Skikun *qələcing*. Unlike Squliq, \*ɹ > y did not cause a preceding \*t to affricate: Proto-Atayal \*taɹasiʔ 'straw hat' > Skikun *tyasiʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*təɹugal 'three' > Skikun *tyugal*.
3. **Vowel lenition.** Vowels outside the rightmost foot, i.e. third-to-last syllable and beyond, were lenited into /ə/: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Skikun *kəneril*, Proto-Atayal *turakis* 'foxtail millet' > Skikun *tərakis*, Proto-Atayal *pisaniq* 'taboo' > Skikun *pəsaniq*. There are at least two exceptions with \*ay in the third-to-last syllable: Proto-Atayal \*-baytunux 'beautiful' > Skikun *betunux*, Proto-Atayal \*qayqayaʔ 'thing' > Skikun *qeqayaʔ*.

   Note that in the AV infix *-əm-* and AV prefix *mə-* the vowel is lenited even if it falls on the penultimate syllable. The voice morphology is discussed in @sec:voice-system.
4. **Vowel coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \*mVnakuʔum 'dark' > Skikun *mənəkum*. When the penultima was a low vowel \*a, and the ultima a high vowel, they merged into a mid vowel: Proto-Atayal \*-raʔuŋ 'hook (for hanging things)' > Skikun *rərong*, Proto-Atayal \*baʔis 'partner, spouse' > Skikun *bes*. When the penultima was a high vowel an the ultima a low vowel, the high vowel became a glide and the two syllables merged into a single CGVC syllable: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > Skikun *ryax*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.

   This process was combined with the **monophthongization of offglides** in the penultima. The offglides \*aw and \*ay were monophthongized into mid vowels, but only in the penultimate syllable: Proto-Atayal \*tawkan 'net bag carried on back' > Skikun *tokan*, Proto-Atayal \*haylag 'fast' > Skikun *helax*.
5. **\*g devoicing.** Proto-Atayal \*g was regularly devoiced in word-final position, merging with \*x: Proto-Atayal \*muɹag 'house' > Skikun *muyax*, Proto-Atayal \*siniyug 'rope' > Skikun *sənyux*. Word-finally after \*i, \*g was deleted instead, with compensatory lengthening on the vowel: Proto-Atayal \*tulaqig 'eel' > Skikun *təlaqiy*. This deletion may have taken place prior to devoicing.

   Skikun /g/ is also quite frequently devoiced word-initially, and /x/ voiced intervocalically, to the point where it may no longer be necessary to separate them into two phonemes. However, this problem requires additional study before drawing a conclusion one way or the other. See also discussion in @sec:skikun-consonants.
6. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced into /p/ in word-final position in Skikun: Proto-Atayal \*humab 'to stab, to spear' > Skikun *həmap*. In verbal roots, \*b will generally surface as /b/ after suffixation, see @sec:final-devoicing for more details.
7. **Liquid assimilation.** When a Proto-Atayal word had an onset \*r followed by an onset \*l, the first \*r became /l/ in Skikun: Proto-Atayal \*raluʔ 'name' > Skikun *laluʔ*. This rule was not applied when the second liquid was in coda position, either in the same syllable or in a different one: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Skikun *kəneril*, Proto-Atayal \*rapal 'sole (of foot)' > Skikun *rapal*.
8. **Dorsal harmony.** Proto-Atayal \*k became /q/ in Skikun if it was followed by \*q anywhere in the world. The harmony with \*q was exceptionless, according to my data: Proto-Atayal \*-kuriq 'to steal' > Skikun *məquriq* (cf. C'uli' *məkuri*), Proto-Atayal \*kisəliq 'to love, to like' > Skikun *qəsəliq* (cf. Matu'uwal *kisliq*). It was also backed in Proto-Atayal \*kVtəhuɹ 'fat, stout' > Skikun *qətəhuy*, and Proto-Atayal \*-kapah 'to stick' > Skikun *qəmapah*, but unlike Squliq, there is no systematic backing of \*k before \*q, so these two words may be borrowed from Squliq.
9. **\*-lit > -liʔ.** In this very specific sound change, the Proto-Atayal final syllables \*-lit and \*-liʔ were merged into *-liʔ* in Skikun: Proto-Atayal \*qabulit 'ashes' > Skikun *qəbuliʔ*, cf. Plngawan *ʔabulit*. See @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d for a detailed explanation.
10. **Fortition of \*w before schwa.** In trisyllabic words where the first syllable began with \*w, it was fortitioned into a fricative: Proto-Atayal \*waqanux 'sambar deer' > Skikun *bəqanux*, Proto-Atayal \*waciluŋ 'pond, lake' > Skikun *bəcilung*, Proto-Atayal \*wariyuŋ 'neck' > Skikun *gəryung*. This was likely a repair strategy to avoid an illegal /wə/ sequence. The choice between /b/ and /g/ is unclear, as the aforementioned three lexical items are the only examples of this change. The words are also identical to those in Squliq, but with a regular correspondence of /c/ and /s/ between Skikun *bəcilung* and Squliq *bəsilung* 'pond, lake'.

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the sound changes in Skikun:

- 3 > 4 (vowel lenition preceded vowel coalescence): Proto-Atayal \*mVnakuʔum 'dark' > Skikun *mənəkum* instead of \*\*mənakum.
- 3 > 10 (vowel lenition preceded \*w fortition): Proto-Atayal \*waqanux > Skikun *bəqanux* instead of \*\*wəqanux.

The following are ongoing and spontaneous changes in Skikun:

- Word-final \*l may be merged into /n/ in Skikun, especially by younger speakers, though more conservative speakers still retain the distinction.
- The phoneme /c/ or /s/ was spontaneously palatalized in some words: Proto-Atayal \*maculiŋ 'to burn (intr.)' > Skikun *məcyuling*; Skikun *cyungaʔ*, cf. Matu'uwal *cungaʔ*; Skikun *syupan* 'bottle', cf. C'uli' *supan*.
<!-- TODO: are these Proto-Atayal? -->

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to C'uli' {#sec:proto-atayal-to-cu}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to C'uli' can be indentified:

1. **\*q, \*ʔ > ʔ.** Proto-Atayal \*q merged into the glottal stop /ʔ/ in C'uli': Proto-Atayal \*qawlit 'mouse' > C'uli' *ʔolit*, Proto-Atayal \*taquɹ 'crow' > C'uli' *taʔuy*.
2. **\*ɹ, \*y > y.** The retroflex approximant \*ɹ fully and unconditionally merged into \*y: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > C'uli' *yungay*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > C'uli' *wayay*, Proto-Atayal \*malikuɹ 'man, husband' > C'uli' *məlikuy*.
3. **Vowel lenition.** Vowels outside the rightmost foot, i.e. third-to-last syllable and beyond, were lenited into /ə/: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > C'uli' *kənerin*, Proto-Atayal *turakis* 'foxtail millet' > C'uli' *tərakis*, Proto-Atayal *pisaniq* 'taboo' > C'uli' *pəsani*.

   Note that in the AV infix *-əm-* and AV prefix *mə-* the vowel is lenited even if it falls on the penultimate syllable. The voice morphology is discussed in @sec:voice-system.
4. **Vowel coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \*miʔiŋ 'to hold in hand' > C'uli' *ming*. When the penultima was a low vowel \*a, and the ultima a high vowel, they merged into a mid vowel: Proto-Atayal \*kaʔur 'Taiwan beauty snake (錦蛇)' > C'uli' *kor*, Proto-Atayal \*baʔis 'partner, spouse' > C'uli' *bes*. When the penultima was a high vowel an the ultima a low vowel, the high vowel became a glide and the two syllables merged into a single CGVC syllable: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > C'uli' *ryax*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.

   This process was combined with the **monophthongization of offglides** in the penultima. The offglides \*aw and \*ay were monophthongized into mid vowels, but only in the penultimate syllable: Proto-Atayal \*tawkan 'net bag carried on back' > C'uli' *tokan*, Proto-Atayal \*haylag 'fast' > C'uli' *helaw*.
5. **\*m > ng /\_#; \*p > k /\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final labials merged into velars: Proto-Atayal \*raʔum 'needle' > C'uli' *rong*, Proto-Atayal \*kuməɹap 'to grab' > C'uli' *kəməyak*. See also @sec:merger-labial-velar for examples of synchronic alternations caused by this sound change.
6. **\*g > w /a\_#; > ∅ /V\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final \*-g was changed in one of two ways in C'uli', depending on the preceding vowel. When preceded by \*a, it merged with \*w: Proto-Atayal \*ʔurag 'dirt' > C'uli' *ʔuraw* 'earth'. When preceded by a high vowel, it was deleted: Proto-Atayal \*kəgig 'hemp, ramie' > C'uli' *kəgi*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > C'uli' *bicyu* (with spontaneous palatalazation of /c/, see below).
7. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced into /p/ in word-final position in C'uli'. Later, it shifted to a velar place of articulation (rule 5): Proto-Atayal \*pahəgub > C'uli' *pəhəguk*.
8. **Liquid assimilation.** When a Proto-Atayal word had an onset \*r followed by an onset \*l, the first \*r became /l/ in C'uli': Proto-Atayal \*raluʔ 'name' > C'uli' *lalu*. This rule was not applied when the second liquid was in coda position, either in the same syllable or in a different one (although in C'uli' generally changed \*l > n word-finally): Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > C'uli' *kənerin*, Proto-Atayal \*rapal 'sole (of foot)' > C'uli' *rapan*.
9. **\*ʔ > ∅ /\_#.** Glottal stops were lost in word-final position in C'uli': Proto-Atayal \*kəhuʔ 'granary' > C'uli' *kəhu* (see also @sec:culi-phonotactics). Unlike S'uli', vowel coalescence was not affected by this change: Proto-Atayal \*kaʔiʔ 'speech, language' > C'uli' *ke* (cf. S'uli' *kay*).

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the sound changes in C'uli':

- 7 > 5 (final \*b devoicing preceded final labial to velar merger): Proto-Atayal \*pahəgub > C'uli' *pəhəguk* instead of \*\*pəhəgu.
- 4 > 9 (vowel coalescence preceded final glottal stop deletion): Proto-Atayal \*kaʔiʔ > C'uli' *ke* instead of \*\*kay.

There are also some irregular or ongoing sound changes in C'uli':

- Word-final \*l may be merged into /n/. According do data in @li1998, \*l may be preserved word-finally in some C'uli'-speaking villages, although the reflexes he gives are not systematic. For more information, see @sec:culi-consonants.
- The sound change **t > c /\_i** appears in some words, but not others, and sometimes two variants of a single word may be accepted, e.g. *tisan* and *cisan* 'to visit'. Since the data does not show a systematic change (and since there are even competing variants), the affrication is most likely due to influence from Squliq.
- The phoneme /c/ or /s/ was spontaneously palatalized in some words: Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > C'uli' *bicyu*, Proto-Atayal \*cacaping 'broom' > C'uli' *cyaping* 'a plant used to make brooms', Proto-Atayal \*maculing 'to burn' > C'uli' *cyuling*, Proto-Atayal \*sasiq 'shade' > C'uli' *syasi*.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Matu'aw {#sec:proto-atayal-to-mw}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Matu'aw can be indentified:

1. **\*c, \*s > s.** The affricate \*c fully and unconditionally merged into \*s: Proto-Atayal \*cumaqis 'to sew' > Matu'aw *sumaʔis*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Matu'aw *bisuw*.
2. **\*q, \*ʔ > ʔ.** Proto-Atayal \*q merged into the glottal stop /ʔ/ in Matu'aw: Proto-Atayal \*qaʔum 'pangolin' > Matu'aw *ʔawm*, Proto-Atayal \*taquɹ 'crow' > Matu'aw *taʔuy*.
3. **Vowel/syllable coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \*hiʔiʔ 'meat, flesh' > Matu'aw *hiʔ*.^[Matu'aw *manakuʔum* 'foggy' (< Proto-Atayal \*mVnakuʔum) is an exception to this rule.]

   When one of the vowels was high and the other low, the high vowel became a glide and the two syllables merged into a single syllable, either CGVC or CVGC: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > Matu'aw *ryax*, Proto-Atayal \*qaʔum 'pangolin' > Matu'aw *ʔawm*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.
4. **\*ɹ, \*y > y.** The retroflex approximant \*ɹ fully and unconditionally merged into \*y: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Matu'aw *yungay*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > Matu'aw *wayay*, Proto-Atayal \*malikuɹ 'man, husband' > Matu'aw *mamalikuy* 'young man'.
5. **\*ə, \*a > a.** Proto-Atayal schwa was fully merged with \*a: Proto-Atayal \*qasəɹuʔ 'pestle' > Matu'aw *ʔasayuʔ*.
6. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced into /p/ in word-final position in Matu'aw: Proto-Atayal \*humagub 'to scry, to practice shamanism' > Matu'aw *humagup*. In verbal roots, /b/ resurfaces after suffixation, see @sec:final-devoicing for more details.
7. **Lenition of word-final \*g.** As recently as 1980, conservative Matu'aw speakers still preserved word-final /g/ after all vowels, including /i/, according to data collected by Li [-@li1980;@li1981;@li1982b]. This sound has since disappeared from the language in exactly the same way as other dialects, by merging with /w/ after /a/, and by merging with ∅ and lengthening a preceding vowel after /u/ and /i/: Proto-Atayal \*tulaqig 'eel' > Matu'aw *tulaʔiy*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Matu'aw *bisuw*, Proto-Atayal \*sumamag 'to make the bed' > Matu'aw *sumamaw*.

Only one chronological ordering is needed for Matu'aw sound changes:

- 3 > 2 (vowel/syllable coalescence preceded \*q > ʔ): Proto-Atayal \*maqut 'to ask' > Matu'aw *maʔut* instead of \*\*mawt.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Plngawan {#sec:proto-atayal-to-pl}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Plngawan can be indentified:

1. **\*q, \*ʔ > ʔ.** Proto-Atayal \*q merged into the glottal stop /ʔ/ in Plngawan: Proto-Atayal \*qawlit 'mouse' > Plngawan *ʔolit*, Proto-Atayal \*guqiluh 'banana' > Plngawan *gaʔiloh*.
2. **Changes of \*ə.** Proto-Atayal \*ə changed into a cardinal vowel or was deleted, depending on the environment. In trisyllabic words, penultimate \*ə was normally deleted and the word resyllabified: Proto-Atayal \*matəɹuʔ 'six' > Plngawan *matɹuʔ*. In disyllabic words, penultimate \*ə either became /a/ or copied the vowel in the final syllable: Proto-Atayal \*ɹəɹik 'deep' > Plngawan *ɹaɹik*, Proto-Atayal \*bəliŋ 'hole' > Plngawan *baling*, Proto-Atayal \*bəhut 'squirrel' > Plngawan *buhut*, Proto-Atayal \*həɹiŋ 'honey, honeybees' > Plngawan *hiɹing*. Sadly, there is not enough data to determine how the vowel was selected. See also correspondences of \*ə in @sec:vowel-correspondences.
3. **Vowel coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \*mVnakuʔum 'dark' > Plngawan *minakung*. When one of the vowels was the low vowel \*a and another was a high vowel \*i or \*u, they merged into a mid vowel: Proto-Atayal \*-raʔuŋ 'hook (for hanging things)' > Plngawan *paparong*, Proto-Atayal \*baʔis 'partner, spouse' > Plngawan *bes*, Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > Plngawan *rex*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.

   This process was combined with the **monophthongization of offglides** in the penultima. The offglides \*aw and \*ay were monophthongized into mid vowels, but only in the penultimate syllable: Proto-Atayal \*tawkan 'net bag carried on back' > Plngawan *tokan*, Proto-Atayal \*panayluq 'arrow' > Plngawan *paneluʔ*.
   
   Additionally, the sequences \*-uwa-, \*-iya-, and \*-iyu- were also monophthongized: Proto-Atayal \*-uwa- > Plngawan /o/, Proto-Atayal \*-iya- > Plngawan /e/, Proto-Atayal \*-iyu- > Plngawan /i/. Regular correspondences include Proto-Atayal \*giyus 'intestines' > Plngawan *gis*, Proto-Atayal \*qusiyaʔ 'water' > Plngawan *ʔuseʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*qaliyan 'daytime' > Plngawan *ʔalen*, Proto-Atayal \*buwax 'unhusked rice' > Plngawan *box*. The monophthongization of \*-iya- and \*-iyu was blocked before \*-g: Proto-Atayal \*siniyug 'rope' > Plngawan *sinyuw*, Proto-Atayal \*siyag 'edge, rim' > Plngawan *syaw*. When \*-uwa- was immediately preceded by \*q, it changed into /awa/ instead: Proto-Atayal \*quwalax 'rain' > Plngawan *ʔawalax*, but Proto-Atayal \*qumuwalax 'to rain (AV)' > Plngawan *ʔumolax*. See also @sec:vowel-correspondences for more examples and explanation of these correspondences.
4. **\*m > ng /\_#; \*p > k /\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final labials merged into velars: Proto-Atayal \*raʔum 'needle' > Plngawan *rong*, Proto-Atayal \*kuməɹap 'to grab' > Plngawan *kunɹak*. See also @sec:merger-labial-velar for examples of synchronic alternations caused by this sound change.
5. **Rhotacism: \*s > r /i\_V́.** Proto-Atayal \*s becomes /r/ in Plngawan under very specific conditions: only when it is preceded by \*i and followed by a stressed vowel (i.e. final vowel). For example, Proto-Atayal \*pisaʔ 'how many' > Plngawan *piraʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*ʔisah 'older brother's wife' > Plngawan *ʔirah*.

   If the vowel preceding \*s is anything other than \*i, rhotacism does not occur, e.g. Proto-Atayal \*musaʔ 'to go (AV)' > Plngawan *musaʔ*. Rhotacism is also blocked if \*s does not immediately precede stress: Proto-Atayal \*pisaniq 'taboo' > Plngawan *pisaniʔ*.
6. **\*g > w /a\_#; > ∅ /V\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final \*-g was changed in one of two ways in Plngawan, depending on the preceding vowel. When preceded by \*a, it merged with \*w: Proto-Atayal \*ʔurag 'dirt' > Plngawan *ʔuraw*. When preceded by a high vowel, it was deleted, and the vowel was lengthened: Proto-Atayal \*bunaqig 'sand' > Plngawan *bunaʔiy*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Plngawan *bicuw*.
7. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced in word-final position in Plngawan, and its place of articulation then changed to velar (rule 4): Proto-Atayal \*-tVɹab 'tongs' > Plngawan *pataɹak*. In verbal roots, the labial will surface after suffixation, though in Plngawan it is usually /p/ and not /b/, likely due to paradigm leveling between the application of the two sound changes, see @sec:paradigm-leveling for more details on paradigm leveling.
8. **\*ay > iy /\_#.** The Proto-Atayal offglide \*ay changed to /iː/ (written \<iy\>) in word-final position: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Plngawan *ɹungiy*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > Plngawan *waɹiy*. See also @sec:vowel-correspondences.

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the sound changes in Plngawan:

- 3 > 1 (vowel coalescence preceded \*q > ʔ): Proto-Atayal \*cumaqis 'to sew (AV)' > Plngawan *cumaʔis* instead of \*\*cumes.
- 7 > 4 (final \*b devoicing preceded final labial to velar merger): Proto-Atayal \*patVɹab > Plngawan *pataɹak* instead of \*\*pataɹaw.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Matu'uwal {#sec:proto-atayal-to-ml}

Matu'uwal has had relatively few sound changes, compared to the other dialects. The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Matu'uwal can be indentified:

1. **Changes of \*ɹ.** Proto-Atayal \*ɹ changed in several ways in Matu'uwal, depending on the environment and, in one case, on the subdialect.

   The regular correspondence of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ in most cases in Matu'uwal is ∅. Word-finally, it was deleted and the preceding vowel lengthened:
Proto-Atayal \*raŋaɹ 'deadfall trap' > Matu'uwal *ranga*
Proto-Atayal \*lihuɹ 'forehead' > Matu'uwal *lihuw*.^[Note that long high vowels are typically marked with a corresponding glide, however long low vowels are left unmarked. These contrast with words ending in a final glottal stop.] Between vowels, it was deleted, leading either to a hiatus (with identical vowels or a low-high sequence), or an epenthetic glide (in a high-low sequence or between two different high vowels): Proto-Atayal \*buɹul 'loincloth' > Matu'uwal *buul*, Proto-Atayal \*kaɹal 'sky' > Matu'uwal *kaal*, Proto-Atayal \*caɹiʔ 'taro' > Matu'uwal *caiʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*masibaɹux 'to share field work' > Matu'uwal *məsibaux*, Proto-Atayal \*xuɹil 'dog' > Matu'uwal *xuwil*, Proto-Atayal \*muɹag 'house, home' > Matu'uwal *ʔimuwag*.

   Word-initially, it was deleted before high vowels, with an epenthetic glottal stop being inserted to repair a vowel-initial word: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Matu'uwal *ʔungay*, Proto-Atayal \*ɹiŋat 'to rob, to take away' > Matu'uwal *ʔingat*.^[This epenthetic glottal stop is phonemic and appears when the word is prefixed: *pataga-ʔungay* 'to become a monkey', *pa-ʔingac-an* 'to interrupt'.] Word-initially before a low vowel, it was either deleted like high vowels, or became /w/, depending on the subdialect. This led to two forms being acceptable to most speakers: Proto-Atayal \*ɹaŋaw 'housefly' > Matu'uwal *ʔangaw* or *wangaw*, Proto-Atayal \*ɹapit 'flying squirrel' > Matu'uwal *ʔapit* or *wapit*.

   Word-medially and immediately following the offglide \*aw, Proto-Atayal \*ɹ became /w/: Proto-Atayal \*rawɹiq 'eyes' > Matu'uwal *rawwiq*, Proto-Atayal \*gumawɹag 'to wade' > Matu'uwal *gumawwag*. Unlike word-initial reflexes, there is no variation here.
2. **Changes of \*ə.** Penultimate \*ə changed in several different ways in Matu'uwal. In disyllabic words, it was retained as /ə/: Proto-Atayal \*bəliŋ 'hole' > Matu'uwal *bəling*, Proto-Atayal \*bəhut 'squirrel' > Matu'uwal *bəhut*.

   In trisyllabic words, penultimate \*ə was deleted, and the word resyllabified into CVC.CVC: Proto-Atayal \*ɹVkəlit 'leopard' > Matu'uwal *ʔakliʔ* or *wakliʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*qalətiŋ 'wooden plank' > Matu'uwal *qalting*.

   Immediately preceding \*ɹ, schwa assimilated to the following vowel after \*ɹ was deleted: Proto-Atayal \*həɹiŋ 'honey, honeybee' > Matu'uwal *hiing*, Proto-Atayal \*matəɹuʔ 'six' > Matu'uwal *mamatuuʔ*.
3. **\*-aay > -aiy.** The word-final sequence \*-aay created by the deletion of \*ɹ was changed into *-aiy* /a.ˈiː/ instead: Proto-Atayal \*waɹay > Matu'uwal *waiy*. This also affected words with historical penultimate schwa: Proto-Atayal \*kuməɹay 'to dry (e.g. grass)' > Matu'uwal *kumaiy*.
<!-- TODO: add comment on Li's data? -->
4. **Dorsal harmony.** Proto-Atayal \*k became /q/ in Matu'uwal in disyllabic roots beginning with \*k and ending with \*q (kVCVq). This *k*-backing can only be found in three roots in my dataset: Proto-Atayal \*kaniq 'to eat (AV.imp)' > Matu'uwal *qaniq*, Proto-Atayal \*kuriq 'to steal (AV.imp)' > Matu'uwal *quriq*, Proto-Atayal \*kəbaq 'to know (AV.imp)' > Matu'uwal *qəbaq*. Unlike Squliq and Skikun, \*k was not backed in longer words or in other environments: Proto-Atayal \*kisəliq 'to like, to love' > Matu'uwal *kisliq* 'mood', Proto-Atayal \*kahuniq 'tree' > Matu'uwal *kahuniq*. See also @sec:consonant-correspondences for more reflexes of \*k.
5. **\*-lit > -liʔ.** In this very specific sound change, the Proto-Atayal final syllables \*-lit and \*-liʔ were merged into *-liʔ* in Matu'uwal: Proto-Atayal \*qabulit 'ashes' > Matu'uwal *qabuliʔ*, cf. Plngawan *ʔabulit*. See @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d for a detailed explanation.

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the sound changes in Matu'uwal:

- 1 > 2 (\*ɹ deletion preceded changes of \*ə): Proto-Atayal \*qasəɹuʔ > Matu'uwal *qasuuʔ* instead of \*\*qasuʔ.
- 2 > 3 (changes of \*ə preceded \*-aay > -aiy): Proto-Atayal \*kuməɹay > Matu'uwal *kumaiy* instead of \*\*kumiiy.

## Sound correspondences between Proto-Atayal and PAn {#sec:pan-to-proto-atayal}

Out of over 1100 reconstructed Proto-Atayal forms, I have found Proto-Austronesian etyma for only around a tenth of that number. In general, cognacy rates between PAn reconstructions and Atayalic vocabulary are low. Nevertheless, out of more that 100 cognate pairs, regular sound correspondences may be established. They are presented in @tbl:pan-reflexes-proto-atayal.

| e   | ə-/-u           | PAn \*NuqeS 'marrow' > PA \*luqus        |

Note that there are still gaps in the data. For example, I have not been able to identify any cognates with PAn \*g or word-initial \*h, and there is only one instance each of PAn \*r and \*ñ.

As seen in @tbl:pan-reflexes-proto-atayal, some phonemes have different reflexes depending on their position in the word. PAn \*C was reflected as Proto-Atayal \*c except word-finally, where it was reflected as \*t: PAn \*kaRaC 'to bite' > Proto-Atayal \*k\<um\>at, but \*kac-un when suffixed. This is due to a restriction in Proto-Atayal phonotactics, where \*c was not allowed word-finally, and it was merged with \*t in that position, see also @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics.

Proto-Austronesian \*e (a schwa vowel) is reflected in Proto-Atayal as \*u in the final syllable and as \*ə elsewhere: PAn \*buhet 'squirrel' > Proto-Atayal \*bəhut (with vowel metathesis), PAn \*dakeS 'camphor tree' > Proto-Atayal \*rakus, PAn \*qaSelu 'pestle' > Proto-Atayal \*qasəɹuʔ, as well as in the Patient Voice suffix PAn \*-en > Proto-Atayal \*-un. In verbal roots, the vowel alternates after suffixation: PAn \*taNek 'to cook' > Proto-Atayal \*t\<um\>aluk (AV), but \*talək-un (PV).

Proto-Austronesian \*s is regularly reflected as Proto-Atayal \*x word-finally and as \*h elsewhere, with many examples. The following etyma are clearly related, but are exceptions: PAn \*Ciŋas 'food debris' > Proto-Atayal \*ciŋas, and the Formosan etymon \*lapis 'flying squirrel' > Proto-Atayal \*ɹapit. The irregular correspondences might be explained by borrowing early in the language's history.

Proto-Austronesian \*S has the regular reflex \*s in Proto-Atayal, but may also be reflected as \*h in word-initial position. @tbl:pan-s-reflexes lists all occurrences of PAn word-initial \*S in my cognate sets. The affixes in 'four', 'Grey-cheeked fulvetta', 'waist', and 'snow' are derivational affixes used in the gender register system, see @sec:gender-register for details.

| \text{*}SuReNa     | \*hula-qig    | 'snow, ice'             |

Here the amount of words reflecting \*s and \*h in Proto-Atayal is roughly the same. They do not appear to have any conditioning environment, and words in both groups belong in the basic vocabulary. This is a mystery that should be addressed in future research.

There is a small number of PAn etyma with \*j that have reflexes in Proto-Atayal. However, the reflexes are not systematic, as can be seen in @tbl:pan-j-reflexes.

| \text{*}pajay | \*pagay       | 'rice plant'      |
| \text{*}puja  | \*pugaʔ       | 'navel'           |
| \text{*}pijax | \*pisaʔ       | 'how many'        |

In most cases, \*j is simply deleted (the glottal stop in \*sumaʔuk 'to smell' and \*suwaʔiʔ 'younger sibling' was likely epenthetic), but in \*pagay 'rice plant' and \*pugaʔ 'navel' it is reflected as \*g instead. The Atayal traditionally planted millet and not rice, so \*pagay 'rice plant' can be argued to be a borrowing.

The \*s in \*pisaʔ 'how many' is most likely related to the environment: following \*i and preceding a stressed vowel.^[Rhotacism in Squliq and Plngawan occurred in an identical environment.] The irregular correspondence in PAn \*siRa 'yesterday' > Proto-Atayal \*hisaʔ is likely related, although with only two etyma it is difficult to make conclusions. None of the 1100+ Proto-Atayal etyma in my database have the sequence \*-iga-, which suggests a sound change preceding Proto-Atayal (perhaps from Proto-Atayalic to Proto-Atayal). See also @sec:li-proto-atayalic-g for other correspondences in the same environment.

Proto-Austronesian \*R was regularly reflected as Proto-Atayal \*g. There are some exceptions, listed in @tbl:pan-r-reflexes.

: Reflexes of Proto-Austronesian \*R in Proto-Atayal {#tbl:pan-r-reflexes}

| PAn           | Proto-Atayal | Gloss       |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| \text{*}buRuk | \*-buruk     | 'rotten'    |
| \text{*}siRa  | \*hisaʔ      | 'yesterday' |
| \text{*}kaRaC | \*k\<um>at   | 'to bite'   |
| \text{*}daReq | \*raʔuq      | 'ground'    |
| \text{*}kaRi  | \*kaʔiʔ      | 'language'  |
| \text{*}Rubu  | \*ʔubuʔ      | 'den'       |

The reflex in Proto-Atayal \*hisaʔ 'yesterday' was discussed above. Proto-Atayal \*-buruk 'rotten' is the only case of PAn \*R > Proto-Atayal \*r, and is likely a loan. The rest of the etyma have \*R being deleted in Proto-Atayal. At least some of these correspondences may be attributable to the Atayalic gender register system, described in @sec:gender-register. One of the changes in the male register was deleting word-initial or word-medial \*g in Proto-Atayal, which is the regular reflex of PAn \*R. It is possible that for some of these words only the male register form survived.

# Proto-Atayal morphology and lexicon {#sec:morphology-lexicon}

<!-- TODO: intro -->

## Voice system morphology in Proto-Atayal {#sec:voice-system}

Atayal, like most Formosan languages, has what's been variously called the 'Philippine-type aligment', 'Austronesian-type alignment', or 'focus system'. In an Austronesian context, the terms 'focus' and 'voice' mean the same thing and are used interchangeably [@blust2013, p. 437]. In this dissertation, I only use the term 'voice'.

For morphosyntactic phenomena related to the voice system in Austronesian languages in general, the reader is referred to Blust [-@blust2013, sec. 7.1]. The voice system in Matu'uwal Atayal is described from a syntactic and semantic perspective in @huang2001.

The full system in the indicative as well as the subjunctive is presented in @tbl:voice-affixes-proto-atayal. Note that the terms 'subjunctive' or 'irrealis' are commonly used with the focus system of Atayal and Austronesian languages in general. In Atayal specifically, the subjunctive is obligatorily used in negation and imperatives, and is not limited to subordinate clauses.

: Voice affixes in Proto-Atayal {#tbl:voice-affixes-proto-atayal}

|       | Indicative   | Subjunctive |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| AV    | \*ma-/\*-um- | ∅           |
| PV    | \*-un        | \*-i        |
| LV    | \*-an        | \*-i        |
| IV/BV | \*si-        | \*-ani      |

The voice system morphology is largely identical across Atayal dialects, and there are no issues with its reconstruction to Proto-Atayal. The only difference is vowel reduction in the prefixes \*ma- and \*si- as well as the infix \*-um- in four Atayal dialects. Squliq, Skikun, S'uli', and C'uli' (dialects which have prepenultimate vowel reduction) have *mə-*, *sə-*, and *-əm-* instead, respectively. In these four dialects, the aforementioned affixes always have a reduced vowel /ə/, even when it falls on the penultimate syllable and would not be reduced under normal vowel lenition rules: Proto-Atayal \*k\<um\>at 'to bite (AV)' > Squliq, Skikun, S'uli', C'uli' *k\<əm\>at*.

The subjunctive suffixes \*-i and \*-ani are vowel-final, and the vowel is phonetically lengthened. The AV infix \*-um- is left-anchored, inserted between the first consonant and the first vowel of a root.

The two AV indicative affixes \*ma- and \*-um- are distinct. Huang [-@huang2001, pp. 58-59] analyzes their reflexes in Matu'uwal as 'dynamic' (for *-um-*) versus 'static' (for *ma-*). They can appear on the same root, where the difference is usually in valency: Proto-Atayal \*ma-culiŋ 'to be burning' vs \*c\<um\>uliŋ 'to burn s.t.', or \*ma-kəɹay 'dry' vs \*k\<um\>əɹay 'to dry s.t.'. The former is monovalent or monadic, meaning it does not have a specific agent, while the latter is bivalent or dyadic, meaning the agent is specified, and is the subject of the verb. Alternatively, \*ma- could also signify reciprocity: Proto-Atayal \*k\<um\>aɹal 'to say, to speak' vs \*ma-kaɹal 'to discuss, to talk with each other'.

The infix \*-um- would sometimes surface as *m-, replacing the first consonant of the root. This happened most often in roots starting with labial consonants: Proto-Atayal \*mumuɹaʔ 'to plant (AV)' vs \*pumuɹaʔ-un 'to plant (PV)', or \*məhul 'to tie (AV)' vs \*bəhəl-an 'to tie (LV)'. In the AV form of these verbs, the initial \*p or \*b is replaced with \*m in lieu of affixation, a process that Blust [-@blust2013, p. 244] calls 'pseudo nasal substitution'. We know this initial \*m- corresponds to \*-um- and not \*ma- because the former cannot appear together with labials, but the latter can: Proto-Atayal \*ma-bahuq 'to wash clothes (AV)', or \*ma-paŋaʔ 'to carry on back (AV)'. This process of 'pseudo nasal substitution' also appears on some specific verbs that do not start with a labial, e.g. Proto-Atayal \*maniq 'to eat (AV)', but \*kaniq 'to eat (AV.SBJV)'.

## Gender register system in Proto-Atayal and its descendants {#sec:gender-register}

Atayal has gained attention in linguistic literature due to the gender register system in its lexicon. Matu'uwal preserves the system to the fullest extent, and it has collapsed in other dialects except for some occasional remnants [@li1980a;@li1982a;@li1983], although even in Matu'uwal, only a handful of elderly speakers are even aware of this distinction, let alone able to use it correctly. In accordance with this system, men and women would use different roots for the same word, for example the verb 'to weave' in Matu'uwal is *t\<um\>inun* in the female register and *t\<um\>inuq* in the male register. This system should not be confused with grammatical gender as found in, for example, many European languages; grammatical gender is a type of noun class system, but there are no noun classes in Atayal. Unlike grammatical gender on nouns, the Atayal gender register distinction can be found in all types of content words, both nominal and verbal roots, but not every root necessarily has this distinction.

The female register corresponds to Proto-Austronesian cognates in Atayal: PAn \*taNek 'to cook' > Matu'uwal *t\<um\>aluk* (f), cf. *t\<um\>ahuk* (m); or PAn \*kuCu 'head louse' > Matu'uwal *kucuʔ* (f), cf. *kuhing* (m).^[Here and following, '(m)' stands for 'male register' and '(f)' for 'female register'.] The female register is thus the set of inherited roots from which male register roots were later derived.

The gender register system used various processes to derive male register words from female register ones. As seen in @tbl:ml-gender-register, these include suffixes (that can replace the final segment of the final syllable), right-anchored infixes, segment deletion, segment substitution, and in a few rare cases, suppletion. @li1983 provides a comprehensive overview of all derivation strategies with many examples. Li also notes that the choice of derivation strategy is **not predictable**, but instead lexically determined.

: Examples of male register derivation strategies in Matu'uwal {#tbl:ml-gender-register}

| Female register | Male register | Gloss                 |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| hapuy           | hapuniq       | 'fire'                |
| kucuʔ           | kuhing        | 'head louse'          |
| guquh           | guqiluh       | 'banana'              |
| qumasug         | qumasuwag     | 'to divide, to share' |
| ragum           | raum          | 'needle'              |
| mancaqrug       | mancaʔrux     | 'to stand'            |
| ʔibubuh         | bawwak        | 'pig'                 |

Other dialects have lost this distinction, and normally use just one word out of a register pair. Occasionally, both forms are preserved, sometimes with a semantic distinction, and sometimes with the same meaning: Plngawan *pahpuy* or *pahpuniʔ* 'to cook grains', cf. Matu'uwal *hapuy* 'fire (f)' (< PAn \*Sapuy) and *hapuniq* 'fire (m)'; Squliq *qəhuniq* 'tree' and *qahuy* 'firewood', cf. Matu'uwal *kahuniq* 'tree (m)' and *kahuy* 'tree (f)' (< PAn \*kaSiw).

The gender register system can be reconstructed to Proto-Atayalic, since traces of male register suffixes can be found in Seediq, e.g. Seediq *qəbulic* 'ash', cf. Proto-Atayal \*qabulit, PAn \*qabu. Both Seediq and Atayal have a suffix in this word, so Proto-Atayalic \*qabulit 'ash' can be reconstructed. Likewise for Proto-Atayal \*kuhiŋ and Seediq *quhing* 'head louse', which are derived male register forms of Proto-Atayal \*kucuʔ, cf. Matu'uwal *kucuʔ* 'head louse (f)' < PAn \*kuCu.

The traces of the register system in Seediq are relatively few in number, though undoubtedly already present, as demonstrated above. The system was developed further after the split of Atayal and Seediq, as evidenced by the much larger number of derived lexemes in Atayal.

One very important detail to note is that **the Atayal gender register system was not static.** Instead, it continued to be productive after the split of Proto-Atayal. We can tell this is the case for two reasons: first, there may be more than one male register form across dialects for a single etymon; and second, loanwords were also affected.

A number of etyma have two male register reflexes in diffent dialects, some of which are shown in @tbl:diff-male-reg.^[Abbreviations in this and the following table are: Ml = Matu'uwal, S' = S'uli', Sk = Skikun, Pl = Plngawan, Mw = Matu'aw, Kl = Klesan.] The first column shows reconstructed items from the female register (including two that do not have direct reflexes, more on that below), while the second and third columns display derived male register forms and the dialect in which they occur.

: Different male register forms in different dialects {#tbl:diff-male-reg}

| Proto-Atayal Fem. | Male reg. 1   | Male reg. 2     | Gloss          |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| \text{*}həmaʔ     | həmaʔuy (S')  | həmaliʔ (Sk)    | 'tongue'       |
| \text{*}ɹangaw    | ɹanglit (Pl)  | ngəryux (Kl)    | 'housefly'     |
| \text{*}hagaʔ     | haʔ (Pl)      | həgayung (S')   | 'stone wall'   |
| \text{*}mitaʔ     | mitaal (Ml)   | mitayux (Mw)    | 'to look (AV)' |
| \text{*}sumVwal   | sumwayal (Mw) | səməwaʔing (Kl) | 'to promise'   |
| \text{*}gipun     | giʔnux (Ml)   | pəniq (Sk)      | 'tooth'        |
| (\text{*}raqis)   | raqinas (Ml)  | raʔyas (Mw)     | 'face'         |
| (\text{*}buɹal)   | buɹating (Pl) | byaling (Sk)    | 'moon'         |

The items in the first column are identified as female register using at least one of the following two criteria: (1) they are reflexes of PAn etyma, (2) they are found in Matu'uwal as female register forms with a corresponding male register form. All except \*\*raqis 'face' and \*\*buɹal 'moon' have reflexes in at least one dialect.

The same root may use different derivation strategies in different dialects. For example, Proto-Atayal female register \*hagaʔ 'stone wall' corresponds to Plngawan *haʔ*, with deletion of /g/ followed by vowel coalescence, and to S'uli' *həgayung*, which uses suffixation instead. This confirms Li's [-@li1983] conclusion that the choice of derivation cannot be predicted phonologically.

In parallel with different derivation strategies for the same root, the gender register distinction may give rise to suppletive forms in verbal paradigms. For example the Klesan verb *səməwaʔing* 'to promise (AV)' has the male register suffix *-ʔing*, as can be seen in @tbl:diff-male-reg, but its LV form is *swalan*, which is a reflex of the female register stem, reconstructed in Proto-Atayal as \*sVwal.

The forms \*raqis 'face' and \*buɹal 'moon' do not have direct reflexes in any dialect, however both have corresponding PAn etyma: PAn \*daqiS 'face' and \*bulaN 'moon'. Additionally, there is the Matu'uwal verb *turaqis* 'to wash one's face', which appears to have been derived from the unattested \*raqis plus the prefix *tu-*. See also @tbl:fem-register-derived-verbs and surrounding discussion for more on derived verbs and the gender register system.

A few etyma have as many as three different male register forms across dialects, an attestation of the productive nature of the gender register system even after the breakup of Proto-Atayal. The words in @tbl:three-male-reg are presented in five columns, with Proto-Atayal etyma in the leftmost column. The Proto-Atayal forms were reconstructed based on female register forms in Matu'uwal, checked against the most common denominator in derived male register forms. The following three columns present various derived forms, including the male register in Matu'uwal and related forms in Plngawan.

: Etyma with three different male register forms across dialects {#tbl:three-male-reg}

| Proto-Atayal | Matu'uwal (f) | Matu'uwal (m) | Plngawan | Other          | Gloss     |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| \*guməbul    | gumbul        | gumuuq        | ʔumbul   | gəməʔul (Sk)   | 'to bury' |
| \*giqas      | giqas         | ʔiqas         | gaʔaɹus  | gaʔanus (Mw)   | 'new'     |
| \*gVlahaŋ    | gilahang      | ʔilahang      | ɹahalang | gəlabang  (Sk) | 'wide'    |

Here we see segment replacement and infixation being used in various ways. In 'to bury', Plngawan replaced the initial segment \*g, whereas Skikun replaced the medial consonant \*b. In 'new', Matu'uwal uses initial consonant deletion/substitution, while Plngawan and Matu'aw use infixes, though different ones. In 'wide', both Plngawan replaced the initial consonant \*g with /ɹ/ while Matu'uwal deleted it. Initial /ʔ/ in Matu'uwal may come from historical \*ɹ, but we would expect reflexes to appear in other dialects, which they do not. Skikun and Squliq *gəlabang*, Matu'aw *galahang*, and even Seediq *gəlahang* all point to initial \*g in Proto-Atayal, so the Plngawan and Matu'uwal male register forms are more likely independent developments (note also consonant metathesis in Plngawan *ɹahalang*).

There are instances of male register forms being derived for loanwords and lexical innovations. The Proto-Atayal etymon for 'clothes' was \*lukus, reflected in all dialects except Matu'uwal.^[Matu'aw and S'uli' innovated a different word for clothes: Matu'aw *balatan*, S'uli' *latan*. However, the derived verb *ma-lukus* 'to wear clothes' can still be found in these dialects, unlike Matu'uwal.] Matu'uwal instead borrowed the word *siyatuʔ* from Pazih *siatu* 'clothes', and innovated the male register form *situwing* 'clothes (m)'. Unique lexical innovations in Matu'uwal may have male register forms, for example *maqaylup* 'to sleep (f)' and *məqilaap* 'to sleep (m)', or *ʔiblung* 'rice husk, chaff (f)' and *ʔibhung* 'rice husk, chaff (m)'.

In some cases, the female register form of a noun disappeared from some or all dialects, but the root was retained in derived verbs. @tbl:fem-register-derived-verbs presents some examples of this phenomenon. The reconstructed or expected Proto-Atayal female register forms are in the first column. The second column shows the derived verbal forms without corresponding nouns in the dialect. The third column contains the male register forms of the same etyma in that dialect.

: Female register forms being preserved in derived verbs {#tbl:fem-register-derived-verbs}

| Female register | Derived verb   | Male register | Gloss          |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| \text{*}buŋaʔ   | tə-bungaʔ (Kl) | ngahiʔ        | 'sweet potato' |
| \text{*}hapuy   | pə-hapuy (Sq)  | puniq         | 'fire'         |
| (\text{*}haŋal) | ma-hangal (Ml) | hangaliq      | 'shoulder'     |
| (\text{*}raqis) | tu-raqis (Ml)  | raqinas       | 'face'         |

The Proto-Atayal nouns \*buŋaʔ 'sweet potato' and \*hapuy 'fire' can be reconstructed based on female register reflexes in Matu'uwal, which are *bungaʔ* and *hapuy*, respectively. Neither of these can be found in any other dialect, but the roots do appear in related verbs, such as Klesan *təbungaʔ* 'to plant sweet potatoes' and Squliq *pəhapuy* 'to cook grains'.

Reflexes of the female register forms \*haŋal 'shoulder' and \*raqis 'face' are not attested in any dialect, but related verbs can be found. Matu'uwal (among other dialects) has *mahangal* 'to carry on shoulder' and *turaqis* 'to wash one's face', which must have been derived from the aforementioned female register nouns. There is additional external evidence from PAn \*daqiS 'face' which lends more weight to \*raqis as the original form.

When reconstructing Proto-Atayal etyma, the gender register system needs to be accounted for. Because it continued being productive after the split of Proto-Atayal, not all male register forms can be reconstructed to that level. Instead, innovations in the gender register system, be it lexical items of even new derivation strategies, can be used for subgrouping. Additional external evidence can also help with reconstructions. Seediq may show that some etyma were affixed even in Proto-Atayalic, as is the case with \*qabulit 'ash'. Proto-Austronesian etyma can be helpful in determining female register forms where there are no direct reflexes, for examle PAn \*daqiS 'face' > Proto-Atayal \*raqis.
