## Phoneme inventories and phonotactics

<!-- TODO: add/rewrite. stress here? -->

The consonant inventories of the various Atayal dialects are mostly very similar to each other. The major differences are in the presence of absence of /q/ and /c/ phonemes, which in some dialects merge with /ʔ/ and /s/, respectively.

In the following sections, I will describe the consonant inventories of seven Atayal dialects separately, providing specifics of articulation where appropriate.

### Squliq

#### Consonant inventory

Squliq is the biggest Atayal dialect in terms of the number of speakers and the geographical area over which it is spoken. There is inevitably a certain amount of phonetic variation in Squliq spoken in various geographically separate locations. Nevertheless, the differences between varieties of Squliq do not extend to the consonant inventory. @tbl:squliq-consonants presents the consonant phonemes of Squliq.

p     & t        & k      & q     & ' [ʔ] \\

      & (c [ts]) &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
      & (z [ʑ])  &        &       &       \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Squliq preserves /q/ and /ʔ/ as separate phonemes. The voiced labial obstruent /b/ is most realized as a voiced labiodental fricative [v], but can also be a voiced bilabial fricative [β] in the speech of older and more conservative speakers.

The quasi-phoneme /c/ is not found in the dialect as a distinct root-internal phoneme, but coronal affricates can still appear in the dialect in several situations: (1) as an allophone of /t/ before the high front vowel /i/ or the palatal approximant /y/, (2) as an allophone of /t/ in word-final position, and (3) in the derivational prefix *c-* [@egerod1966, p. 123;@li1980, pp. 362-363].

In the first case, it is fully in complementary distribution with the plosive [t], and can be analyzed as an allophone of the phoneme /t/ directly preceding the vowel /i/ or the glide /y/. Note that while orthographically it is still written as \<c\>, phonetically it is an alveolo-palatal affricate [tɕ].

Word-final /t/ may also be affricatized as [ts] in the speech of some Squliq speakers, and this is sometimes reflected in writing [@huang2016a, p. 12]. This is a purely phonetic feature and has no bearing on the phonological system of the dialect.

The derivational prefix *c-* is what makes /c/ a quasi-phoneme. This prefix forms causative and reciprocal verbs, among other functions [@rau1992, pp. 102-104;@hayung2008, sec. 2.8]: e.g. *c-* + *baq* 'to know' > *cbaq* 'to teach', *c-* + *beng* 'to grasp' > *cbeng* 'to grasp each other'. Phonetically speaking, it is followed by a schwa vowel, so *cbaq* 'to teach' is pronounced [tsə.ˈvaq]. The prefix *c-* contrasts with another derivational prefix *t-* [@hayung2008], so they cannot be analyzed as allophones here.

The status of /z/, phonetically a voiced alveolo-palatal fricative [ʑ], was addressed by @huang2015a, who examined its distribution relative to /y/ in several varieties of Squliq. Huang's conclusion was that the two sounds are in complementary distribution in some varieties of Squliq, but minimally contrastive in others [@huang2015a, p. 254]. Even in varieties that show a distinction between /z/ and /y/, there are no minimal pairs, and the phonemic status of /z/ remains marginal.

#### Vowel inventory

#### Phonotactics

Squliq disallows true consonant clusters [@huang2006a]. Any apparent tautosyllabic consonant clusters have an intervening schwa vowel that is unwritten in the orthography of the language. Tautosyllabic CG sequences can be found, but are not consonant clusters: the glide in these sequences phonologically behaves like a vowel, and is therefore analyzed as part of the nucleus [@huang2006a, sec. 5].

The syllable types of Squliq Atayal are presented in @tbl:squliq-syllable-types. The table includes only those syllable types which are found across different varieties of Squliq. Some varieties allow more complex syllable structure, as discussed below.

: Syllable types in Squliq Atayal {#tbl:squliq-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss             |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| CV            | qu.tux  | 'one'             |
| CVː           | bi.suw  | 'worm'            |
| CGV           | qwa.lax | 'rain'            |
| CVC           | baq     | 'to know'         |
| CGVC          | qwaw    | 'alcoholic drink' |

The syllable type CVː is alternatively analyzed as CVG with a homorganic glide coda [@huang2006a, p. 61]. The vowels in these syllables are limited to /i/ and /u/, and the syllables can only occur in word-final position. The vowel length in these syllables comes from an original consonantal coda, which lenited and is no longer found in Squliq [@li1981, sec. 2.8]. The same syllable type can be seen in all dialects of Atayal, with the same or similar origin.

There are variations in the phonotactics of Squliq in different regions. Huang [-@huang2006a, p. 66] notes that Taoshan Squliq allows root-internal codas and word-final CVGC syllables, but Jianshi Squliq does not. @tbl:squliq-syllable-types includes syllable types found in all varieties of Squliq.

Some Squliq consonants have a limited distribution. The phoneme /x/ cannot occur word-initially [@li1981, p. 239]. The phonemes /b/ and /g/ cannot occur word-finally, and neither can the quasi-phoneme /z/ [@li1981, p. 240]. @li1981 also claimed that /r/ was disallowed in word-final position in Squliq, but Huang [-@huang2006a, p. 64] listed several counterexamples with word-final /r/ in Taoshan Squliq. Even though /r/ can appear word-finally, it is extremely rare in this position, and is replaced with /l/ by some speakers.

Some Squliq speakers do not allow /l/ to occur in word-final position, and replace it with /n/ [@rau2000]. This is a sound change in progress; it has not yet completed for all Squliq speakers. This merger can also be found in other Atayal dialects, see @sec:merger-final-l-n.

Squliq, like several other Atayal dialects, has a vowel weakening rule under which all vowel distinctions outside the rightmost foot are lost [@egerod1965, p. 255-257;@li1980, pp. 369-370]. This weakening rule is demonstrated in @sec:prepen-vowel-weakening. Put another way, this rule means that no vowels other than schwa can occur anywhere except the final two syllables. One exception in native Atayal vocabulary is the perfective infix *-in-* in some varieties of Squliq, where it retains its vowel regardless of its position within a word. Another exception is the interjection *talagay* 'wow!', which has a cardinal vowel in the third-to-last syllable.
