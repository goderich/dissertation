## Phoneme inventories and phonotactics

<!-- TODO: add/rewrite. stress here? -->

The consonant inventories of the various Atayal dialects are mostly very similar to each other. The major differences are in the presence of absence of /q/ and /c/ phonemes, which in some dialects merge with /ʔ/ and /s/, respectively.

In the following sections, I will describe the consonant inventories of seven Atayal dialects separately, providing specifics of articulation where appropriate.

### Squliq

#### Squliq consonant inventory

Squliq is the biggest Atayal dialect in terms of the number of speakers and the geographical area over which it is spoken. There is inevitably a certain amount of phonetic variation in Squliq spoken in various geographically separate locations. Nevertheless, the differences between varieties of Squliq do not extend to the consonant inventory. @tbl:squliq-consonants presents the consonant phonemes of Squliq.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Squliq Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:squliq-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p     & t        & k      & q     & ' [ʔ] \\
b [v] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & c [ts]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
      & (z [ʑ])  &        &       &       \\
m     & n        & ng [ŋ] &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Squliq preserves /q/ and /ʔ/ as separate phonemes. The voiced labial obstruent /b/ is most often realized as a voiced labiodental fricative [v], but can also be a voiced bilabial fricative [β] in the speech of older and more conservative speakers.

The phoneme /c/ is not found in the dialect as a distinct root-internal phoneme, but coronal affricates can still appear in the dialect in several situations: (1) as an allophone of /t/ before the high front vowel /i/ or the palatal approximant /y/, (2) as an allophone of /t/ in word-final position, and (3) in the derivational prefix *c-* [@egerod1966, p. 123;@li1980, pp. 362-363].

In the first case, it is fully in complementary distribution with the plosive [t], and can be analyzed as an allophone of the phoneme /t/ directly preceding the vowel /i/ or the glide /y/. Note that while orthographically it is still written as \<c\>, phonetically it is an alveolo-palatal affricate [tɕ].

Word-final /t/ may also be affricatized as [ts] in the speech of some Squliq speakers, and this is sometimes reflected in writing [@huang2016a, p. 12]. This is a purely phonetic feature and has no bearing on the phonological system of the dialect.

The derivational prefix *c-* is what makes /c/ a phoneme. This prefix forms causative and reciprocal verbs, among other functions [@rau1992, pp. 102-104;@hayung2008, sec. 2.8]: e.g. *c-* + *baq* 'to know' > *cbaq* 'to teach', *c-* + *beng* 'to grasp' > *cbeng* 'to grasp each other'. Phonetically speaking, it is followed by a schwa vowel, so *cbaq* 'to teach' is pronounced [tsə.ˈvaq]. The prefix *c-* contrasts with another derivational prefix *t-* [@hayung2008], so they cannot be analyzed as allophones here.

The status of /z/, phonetically a voiced alveolo-palatal fricative [ʑ], was addressed by @huang2015a, who examined its distribution relative to /y/ in several varieties of Squliq. Huang's conclusion was that the two sounds are in complementary distribution in some varieties of Squliq, but minimally contrastive in others [@huang2015a, p. 254]. Even in varieties that show a distinction between /z/ and /y/, there are no minimal pairs, and the phonemic status of /z/ remains marginal.

#### Squliq vowel inventory

The vowel system of Squliq Atayal has traditionally been analyzed as /a i u e o/ [@egerod1966;@li1980;@huang2006a;@huang2016a]. The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ are much rarer than the vowels /i u a/, and they correspond to VG sequences /ay/ and /aw/ in some varieties of Squliq and other Atayal dialects [@li1980, pp. 354-355]. The high vowels /i/ and /u/ are centralized when adjacent to post-dorsal consonants /q/ and /h/, and may be perceived and written as mid vowels instead. <!-- TODO cite -->

On the other hand, almost no studies treat [ə] as a phoneme, and it is instead considered a purely phonetic vowel that breaks up underlying consonant clusters [@li1980, p. 355]. @yamada1974 do analyze it as a phoneme, but also note that its distribution is constrained to unstressed (non-final) syllables. @cheng2001 presents data that constitutes near-minimal pairs of CG and CəG sequences, e.g. *hwa.hun* 'to destroy (PV)' vs *hə.wa.kun* 'to support by the arm (PV)'. @huang2014 treats these distinctions as stemming from glides being in the nucleus or the onset, but here I shall instead treat schwa as a marginal phoneme based on Cheng's examples.
<!-- TODO: create citation for cheng2001 from huang 2014 -->

The vowel inventory of Squliq Atayal as analyzed here is presented in @tbl:squliq-vowels. The vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ are fully phonemic, while the central vowel /ə/ has a more limited distribution, and is treated as a marginal phoneme.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Squliq Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:squliq-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
e     & (ə)    & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This analysis is different from the commonly used analyses of the Squliq vowel system. The main difference is in the inclusion of /ə/, albeit as a quasi-phoneme due to its limited distribution: it is not able to receive stress and is the 'default' vowel that other vowels are lenited to. The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ can be analyzed as phonemic in some varieties of Squliq, but are absent from others [@li1980, pp. 354-355]. The varieties that do not have /e/ and /o/ phonemes will instead have VG or GV sequences in corresponding positions.

#### Squliq phonotactics

Squliq disallows true consonant clusters [@huang2006a]. Any apparent tautosyllabic consonant clusters have an intervening schwa vowel that is unwritten in the orthography of the language. Tautosyllabic CG sequences can be found, but are not consonant clusters: the glide in these sequences phonologically behaves like a vowel, and is therefore analyzed as part of the nucleus [@huang2006a, sec. 5].

The syllable types of Squliq Atayal are presented in @tbl:squliq-syllable-types. The table includes only those syllable types which are found across different varieties of Squliq. Some varieties allow more complex syllable structure, as discussed below.

: Syllable types in Squliq Atayal {#tbl:squliq-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss             |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| CV            | qu.tux  | 'one'             |
| CGV           | qwa.lax | 'rain'            |
| CVC           | baq     | 'to know'         |
| CGVC          | qwaw    | 'alcoholic drink' |

When open syllables occur word-finally, the vowel is lengthened, for example *bisuw* [vi.ˈsuː] 'worm'. These syllables can alternatively be analyzed as CVG with a homorganic glide coda [@huang2006a, p. 61]. The vowels in these syllables are limited to /i/ and /u/, and the syllables can only occur in word-final position. The vowel length in these syllables comes from an original consonantal coda, which lenited and is no longer found in Squliq [@li1981, sec. 2.8]. The same syllable type can be seen in all dialects of Atayal, with the same or similar origin.
<!-- TODO: add link to reconstruction chapter -->

There are variations in the phonotactics of Squliq in different regions. Huang [-@huang2006a, p. 66] notes that Taoshan Squliq allows root-internal codas and word-final CVGC syllables, but Jianshi Squliq does not. @tbl:squliq-syllable-types includes only syllable types found in all varieties of Squliq.

Some Squliq consonants have a limited distribution. The phoneme /x/ cannot occur word-initially [@li1981, p. 239]. The phonemes /b/ and /g/ cannot occur word-finally, and neither can the quasi-phoneme /z/ [@li1981, p. 240]. @li1981 also claimed that /r/ was disallowed in word-final position in Squliq, but Huang [-@huang2006a, p. 64] listed several counterexamples with word-final /r/ in Taoshan Squliq. Even though /r/ can appear word-finally, it is extremely rare in this position, and is replaced with /l/ by some speakers.

The voiceless dental plosive /t/ is affricatized before a high front vowel /i/ or the corresponding glide /y/, as seen in @tbl:squliq-t-affrication.

: Affrication of /t/ in Squliq {#tbl:squliq-t-affrication}

| Word   | Transcription | Gloss   |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| cimuʔ  | [tɕi.ˈmuʔ]    | 'salt'  |
| cyugal | [tɕu.ˈgal]    | 'three' |

This behaviour can be analyzed as an allophone of the phoneme /t/, or as the phoneme /c/ occurring in complementary distribution with /t/ in this environment. Diachronically speaking, /t/ is in the middle of a split, so both interpretations are possible at this time.

The phoneme /k/ followed by /q/ or /h/ in the same word in other dialects, in Squliq corresponds to /q/ instead. In other words, Squliq tends to avoid /k..q/ or /k..h/ sequences in the same word, though they are not disallowed entirely. See examples in @tbl:dorsal-harmony-squliq [from @li1980, p. 377].

: Dorsal harmony in Squliq {#tbl:dorsal-harmony-squliq}

| Squliq  | S'uli'  | Matu'uwal | Gloss        |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| qəhuniq | kahuniʔ | kahuniq   | 'tree'       |
| qətəhuy | katahuy | kithuw    | 'fat, thick' |

Both words in Squliq have an initial /q/ phoneme, but begin with a /k/ in both S'uli' and Matu'uwal. The final phoneme in 'tree' is /q/ in Squliq and Matu'uwal, and /ʔ/ in S'uli', which is the regular correspondence. Squliq underwent a process called *dorsal consonant harmony*, whereby a historical *k was backed into /q/ in some environments. This process also occurred in Skikun [@li1980, p. 377] and Seediq [@lee2009].
<!-- TODO: add link to regular correspondences and dorsal harmony -->

Some Squliq speakers do not allow /l/ to occur in word-final position, and replace it with /n/ [@rau2000]. This is a sound change in progress; it has not yet completed for all Squliq speakers. This merger can also be found in other Atayal dialects, see @sec:merger-final-l-n.

Squliq, like several other Atayal dialects, has a vowel weakening rule under which all vowel distinctions outside the rightmost foot are lost [@egerod1965, p. 255-257;@li1980, pp. 369-370]. This weakening rule is demonstrated in @sec:prepen-vowel-weakening. Put another way, this rule means that no vowels other than schwa can occur anywhere except the final two syllables. One exception in native Atayal vocabulary is the perfective infix *-in-* in some varieties of Squliq, where it retains its vowel regardless of its position within a word. Another exception is the interjection *talagay* 'wow!', which has a cardinal vowel in the third-to-last syllable.

### Matu'uwal

#### Matu'uwal consonant inventory

Matu'uwal Atayal, spoken in three villages in Tai'an township, Miaoli county, has been described by researchers as 'conservative' [@li1981, p. 236;@huang2000, p. 364]. While this descriptor is overly broad, it is true for some aspects of its phonology, including its consonant inventory, shown in @tbl:matuuwal-consonants.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'uwal Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:matuuwal-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \hline
p     & t        & k      & q     & ' [ʔ] \\
b [β] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & c [ts]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ng [ŋ] &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Matu'uwal preserves historical /q/ and /c/ as separate phonemes, and is one of only two Atayal dialects to do so (the other being Skikun). Older speakers of Matu'uwal use the voiced bilabial fricative [β] pronunciation of the phoneme /b/. Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that allows the phonemes /b/ and /g/ to occur word-finally, see @sec:matuuwal-phonotactics for more details.

Matu'uwal spoken in Qing'an village (清安村) lacks the phoneme /c/, and it completely merged with /s/. My data comes from speakers in Jinshuei village (錦水村), whose dialect preserves the contrast between /c/ and /s/.

#### Matu'uwal vowel inventory

The vowel inventory of Matu'uwal is simpler than that of other dialects. @tbl:matuuwal-vowels presents the vowels of Matu'uwal.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'uwal Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:matuuwal-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline
i     &        & u     \\
      & (ə)    &       \\
      & a      &       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Unlike most other Atayal dialects, Matu'uwal does not have any occurrences of mid vowels [e] and [o] in native vocabulary (though they may occur in Japanese or Sinitic loanwords). Instead, Matu'uwal will have VG sequences /ay/ and /aw/ or hiatuses /ai/ and /au/ where other dialects have mid vowels. @sec:matuuwal-phonotactics goes into more detail on Matu'uwal hiatuses.

Like Squliq, Matu'uwal allows the mid central vowel to occur in the surface representation, but it is quite rare. Matu'uwal does not reduce all prepenultimate vowels, and preserves vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, although it does have vowel reductions of a different kind, see @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng. Its appearance is restricted the initial open syllables, e.g. *bəhut* 'squirrel'.

#### Matu'uwal phonotactics {#sec:matuuwal-phonotactics}

Matu'uwal syllables are maximally CVC [@huang2015, pp. 58-59]. The full range of syllable types is rather small, and presented in @tbl:matuuwal-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in Matu'uwal Atayal {#tbl:matuuwal-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| CV            | qu.tux  | 'one'     |
| VC            | ra.an   | 'road'    |
| CVC           | baq     | 'to know' |

Just like in other Atayal dialects, the vowel in final open syllables is lengthened. Unlike other Atayal dialects, this vowel can be /a/, e.g. *taka* [ta.ˈkaː] 'frog, toad'. This makes it impossible to analyze final open syllables as having an underlying homorganic glide coda, since [a] does not have a corresponding glide [@huang2015, p. 61]. Open syllables in Matu'uwal are mostly due to the deletion of word-final Proto-Atayal \*ɹ. <!-- TODO: link corresponding chapter -->

Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that allows onsetless syllables, but these can only occur in word-final position. Similar to final open syllables, Matu'uwal **hiatuses**, or vowel clusters, are the result of the loss of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ. Hiatuses can be either two identical vowels (/a.a/, /i.i/, /u.u/), or a vowel sequence with decreasing sonority (/a.i/, /a.u/). Phonetically, these hiatuses are distinct from VG sequences: there are two audible syllable peaks; and stress, which is always word-final in all Atayal dialects, falls on the second vowel. The reason for this analysis is the difference in phonological behaviour between these two sets, see @sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution for a detailed explanation.
<!-- [Stress in Atayal is realized as a pitch drop, and stressed syllables also have a higher intensity. Penultimate syllables tend to have a rising pitch in anticipation of the final pitch drop.] -->
<!-- TODO: should i move the discussion of stress somewhere else? -->

Some studies describe CGVC or CVGC syllables in Matu'uwal [@lu2005], but here I agree with Huang [-@huang2015, p. 59] in analyzing them as disyllabic sequences CV.GVC or CV.VC.

Matu'uwal allows closed syllables to occur anywhere within the word instead of limiting them to word-final position: for example *mickackaʔ* 'between' is syllabified as /mic.kac.kaʔ/, consisting of three closed syllables.

Matu'uwal consonants are less restricted in their distribution than in other Atayal dialects. Matu'uwal allows both /b/ and /g/ to occur in word-final position: *humab* 'to stab (AV)', *bicug* 'worm'. The affricate /c/ cannot occur word-finally: it merges with /t/, as detailed in @sec:merger-final-c-t. Unlike most Atayal dialects, Matu'uwal does allow /x/ to occur in word-initial position. [@li1981, p. 240] identified only two lexical items with initial /x/, *xuwil* 'dog' and *xuxuʔ* 'breasts', and I have not encountered any other examples.

Matu'uwal does not lenite all prepenultimate vowels, unlike Squliq, S'uli', C'uli', and Skikun. It preserves vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, as shown in @tbl:matuuwal-antepenult-vowels.

: Vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable in Matu'uwal {#tbl:matuuwal-antepenult-vowels}

| Matu'uwal  | Gloss            |
|------------|------------------|
| t*a*nguqiy | 'horn'           |
| p*i*saniq  | 'taboo'          |
| t*u*rakis  | 'foxtail millet' |

There are still vowel reduction processes of a different nature in Matu'uwal, which are discussed in [@sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution; @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng].

Schwa in Matu'uwal appears almost exclusively in initial open syllables: *bəhut* 'squirrel', *kəgiy* 'hemp', *həmaʔ* 'tongue'. There are very rare exceptions to this tendency: *mantəhawnak* 'to sit (AV)', *sumanmənahuqil* 'to kill (AV)'; but in these cases the syllable carrying the schwa immediately follows a morpheme boundary. Usually a word-medial schwa is deleted, leading to a non-final closed syllable; this is addressed in @sec:historical-schwa-alternations.
