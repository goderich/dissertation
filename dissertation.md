## Abstract {.unnumbered}

This study presents a description of the synchronic phonology of seven Atayal dialects, a reconstruction of Proto-Atayal phonology and lexicon, a reconstruction of some 1100 lexical items in Proto-Atayal in the appendix, and a subgrouping of the seven Atayal dialects into a family tree. The seven dialects are: Squliq, Skikun, Matu'uwal, Plngawan, Klesan, S'uli, and Matu'aw. The Squliq and Matu'uwal dialects have received considerable attention in linguistic literature. The rest have had little to no research done on them, especially with regard to phonology. Data used in the dissertation is primarily from my own fieldwork, which includes approximately 2000 words on average from each dialect.

The phonological descriptions include phoneme inventories, phonotactics, as well as synchronic alternation processes.
The consonant systems are largely similar across dialects, containing from 16 to 18 consonant phonemes. The main differences are: (1) the lack of a /q/ phoneme in Plngawan, Klesan, S'uli, and Matu'aw; (2) the lack of a \<c\> /t͡s/ phoneme in Squliq, S'uli, and Matu'aw (although Squliq is developing a phonemic contrast between \<c\> /t͡s/ and /s/ in some environments); and (3) the presence of a second rhotic /ɹ/ in Plngawan. The vowel systems in Atayal dialects range from 3 vowels in Matu'aw to 6 vowels in Squliq, Skikun, S'uli, and Klesan (including the marginal phoneme /ə/). Three dialects---Matu'uwal, Plngawan, and Matu'aw,---preserve phonemic vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, while the remaining dialects neutralize them. Phonotactically, Matu'uwal is the only dialect to preserve word-final voiced fricatives. In terms of syllable structure, all dialects except Matu'uwal allow CGVC syllables, and some allow even more complexity, with CGVGC syllables attested in Matu'aw.

The phonology of Proto-Atayal is reconstructed based on regular and recurrent sound correspondences between the dialects, in accordance with the standard Comparative Method. Proto-Atayal had a slightly larger consonant inventory than extant dialects, with a total of 19 consonant phonemes: it has the phonemes \*q, \*c, and \*ɹ, but no modern dialect has preserved all three. In contrast to more complexity in its consonants, Proto-Atayal a simple four-vowel system, smaller than most modern Atayal dialects. Apart from the phoneme inventory, I reconstruct the phonotactics of Proto-Atayal: its syllable structure and phoneme distribution restrictions. Proto-Atayal had a relatively simple syllable structure, with the maximum syllable being CVC, and only semivowel codas allowed word-medially.

I divide the Atayal dialects into two main groups---Northern Atayal and Southern Atayal. The Northern subgroup comprises Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun, and is evidenced by the common merger of Proto-Atayal word-final \*\nobreakdash-lit and \*\nobreakdash-liʔ sequences, as well as a number of lexical innovations. Within the Northern subgroup, Squliq and Skikun form the Nuclear Northern Atayal subgroup, as evidenced by no less than five common sound changes and a number of lexical innovations and shared aberrations. The Southern group consists of Plngawan, Klesan, S'uli, and Matu'aw, which share the merger of Proto-Atayal \*q and \*ʔ, and a number of lexical innovations. Within the Southern subgroup, Klesan, S'uli, and Matu'aw form the Nuclear Southern Atayal subgroup, sharing the merger of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ and \*y on the phonological side. S'uli and Matu'aw are even more closely related, forming the Southwestern Atayal subgroup, evidenced by lexical innovations and aberrations, and the merger of \*c and \*s. This new subgrouping is more accurate and more detailed than the previous proposal of a bidialectal divide into *Squliq* and *C'uli'* [@utsurikawa1935].

# Introduction
\pagenumbering{arabic}

Atayal is an Austronesian language spoken in northern and central Taiwan. Together with Seediq, it is part of the Atayalic subgroup of Austronesian. No further genetic relationship is widely accepted for Atayalic. It is considered either a primary branch of Austronesian [@blust1999a], or one of the first surviving offshoots of the Austronesian family [@ross2009].

Atayal is not a monolithic language. Instead, it is a collection of closely related dialects with varying degrees of mutual intelligibity. The aim of this dissertation is to explore the nature of the genetic relationship between the different dialects of Atayal. The final goal is to propose a subgrouping of Atayal dialects.

Note that although I use the word 'dialect' throughout the dissertation, this is not meant as a statement on the status of the linguistic divisions in question. The word 'dialect' has no universally accepted definition, and the difference between 'language' and 'dialect' is not quantifiable in any meaningful way. We understand intuitively that 'dialects' are more closely related to each other than 'languages', but the cut-off point between the two categories cannot be specified. The different varieties of Atayal have historically been called 'dialects', although mutual intelligibility varies depending on the specific dialect pair. I adopt this usage here with the aforementioned caveats in mind.

Lastly, the dissertation is mainly concerned with **Proto-Atayal** (PA), the ancestor language of all Atayal dialects, but sometimes I talk about **Proto-Atayalic** (PAic), which is the ancestor of Atayal and Seediq [see @li1981 for a reconstruction of Proto-Atayalic phonology]. Proto-Atayalic is one node above Proto-Atayal in phylogenetic terms. Readers should be careful to distinguish these two protolanguages.

## Research questions

*"Atayal consists of two major dialect groups: Squliq and C'uli'."* This phrase is often found in the introductory sections of linguistic publications on Atayal [@huang1995a, p. 261;@liao2005, p. 48;@liu2005, p. 89;@huang2006a, p. 490;@yeh2013, p. 135]. Quite often, this claim is unsourced, though some authors do cite earlier publications such as Li [-@li1980, p. 349] or @tsuchida1980 (an unpublished manuscript). Li also provides no citation for this grouping, although it can be found in earlier linguistic-anthropological works, such as Ferrell [-@ferrell1969, p. 68] and Wei [@wei1954, p. 42;@he1956, p. 9], neither of whom cite any sources.

The earliest mention of the *Squliq* and *C'uli'* dichotomy I have been able to find is in the first volume of *The Formosan Native Tribes: A Genealogical and Classificatory Study* (臺灣高砂族系統所屬の研究), published by the Institute of Ethnology of the Taihoku Imperial University [@utsurikawa1935]. The authors divide the Atayal nation into three branches based on how they say the words 'person', 'sun', 'fire', and 'eye' [@utsurikawa1935, sec. 1.1.3]. The branches were named based on the word for 'person': (1) *Səqoleq*, (2) *Tsəʔoleʔ* (or *Səʔoleʔ*), (3) *Sədeq* (or *Səjeq*).^[The third branch encompasses the modern Seediq and Truku nations. At that time they were considered a branch of Atayal.] In reality, the authors recorded more than two dialects of Atayal, as seen in some of their examples: the word 'person' is recorded as *səqoleq*, *tsəʔoreʔ* (sic), *səʔoleʔ*, and *tsiule*, which correspond to the Squliq, Klesan, S'uli, and Plngawan dialects, respectively. They ignored all sound correspondences except those of /q/, and used only a small handful of arbitrarily selected lexical correspondences. In short, this classification is not based on historical linguistics as it is understood now or was understood in 1935, and is superficial and impressionistic at best. Nevertheless, it has remained so thoroughly entrenched in both anthropology and later linguistics, that it is never even cited, let alone questioned.

@ogawa1935, published in the same year, mention dialectal differences in Atayal, but do not provide a classification: the authors only mention the presence or absence of the /q/ phoneme as the most salient phonological distinction between dialects [@ogawa1935, p. 21].

Alongside the division into *Squliq* and *C'uli'*, a second claim may follow in journal articles: that *Squliq* is more uniform, while *C'uli'* is very diverse [@li1980, p. 350;@liu2005, p. 89;@huang2006a, p. 491]. This is not explained further, but the implication here is that there are further subdivisions in *C'uli'*, although this has not been explored in linguistic literature.

The claimed subgrouping has never been supported by linguistic evidence, and is at best a convenient shorthand: Squliq is by far the largest dialect of Atayal, so all non-Squliq dialects were grouped together under the umbrella term *C'uli'*. The names *Squliq* and *C'uli'* are cognates meaning '(other) people', and they imply two sound correspondences: that \<c\> /t͡s/ in *C'uli'* corresponds to *Squliq* /s/, and that /q/ in *Squliq* corresponds to /ʔ/ (often written as an apostrophe) in *C'uli'*. Neither of these sound correspondences is true for all dialects grouped under *C'uli'* (sound correspondences can be found in @sec:sound-correspondences).

@li1985 [pp. 712-716] does mention several criteria for distinguishing *Squliq* and *C'uli'* dialects, citing an unpublished manuscript by @tsuchida1980: (1) the correspondence of *Squliq* /r/ to *C'uli'* /s/, (2) first person clitic pronouns, (3) lexical differences. However, both Li and Tsuchida operated under the assumption that the *Squliq* and *C'uli'* subgrouping was correct, and did not provide any evidence for grouping various dialects under the *C'uli'* umbrella. Lexical similarities between Squliq and Skikun were attributed to borrowing, but no evidence was provided [@li1985, p. 716]. As will become clear in this dissertation, the criteria identified by Tsuchida and Li largely turned out to be innovations in Squliq and its immediate ancestor, the Nuclear Northern Atayal subgroup.

After several years of fieldwork on various Atayal dialects, it became clear to me that **C'uli' is not a clade** in the phylogenetic sense: that is, it is not a valid subgroup. It has never been supported by linguistic evidence, but the claim has been repeated throughout many decades until it became entrenched, and has never been questioned. This underscores the need for a linguistically-based subgrouping.

The main question of this dissertation is, **how are Atayal dialects subgrouped?** My goal is to provide a subgrouping based on the rigorous application of tried and proven methods in historical linguistics. In order to achieve this goal, I need to answer other questions first: what did the phonology and lexicon of Proto-Atayal look like? How did it change in each dialect? Which of the changes are shared between dialects? These questions need to be answered before we can proceed to the subgrouping itself, as explained below in @sec:methodology.

## Methodology {#sec:methodology}

This dissertation employs the **standard Comparative Method** for reconstruction and subgrouping. Each step builds on the finding gleaned during the preceding steps.

The Comparative Method originates in the Neogrammarian hypothesis, postulated by linguists of the Neogrammarian school in the second half of the 19th Century. The Neogrammarian hypothesis, to put it simply, proposes that **sound changes are regular and systematic** [@osthoff1878]. This regularity of sound change can be expressed with rules (or 'laws', as they used to be called) that are applied throughout the vocabulary of a language whenever their conditions are met.

The Comparative Method is the reverse of this process. We collect items with similar form and meaning in languages that are assumed to be genetically related, and group them into putative cognate sets. We then collect and catalog the **regular sound correspondences** between the cognates. In this step, we may also identify irregular sound correspondences, which can be explained by one of: chance resemblance, lexical borrowing, or sporadic sound change.

Once the regular sound correspondences are established, we can use them to reconstruct the phonology and lexicon of the protolanguage. We can then find shared innovations between the daughter languages, and using these, subgroup the languages into a phylogenetic tree. Rarer and more unusual shared innovations constitute more solid evidence for subgrouping. Several common sound changes occurring together are also more convincing for subgrouping than a single common sound change.
<!-- fixme: cite Greenberg 1957 -->

I begin this process for Atayal by collecting the necessary lexical data and analyzing it to arrive at a phonological system for each dialect. My data mostly comes from my own fieldwork (see @sec:sources-of-data). The phonological descriptions in Chapter 3 constitute a necessary step in determining the phonology and phonotactics of Proto-Atayal. Synchronic alternations induced by verbal affixation also form a part of the overall phonological description, and may be motivated by phonotactic constraints. Some of these alternations can in turn be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal, helping determine its phonotactics.

Once the synchronic phonologies of all individual dialects are described, we proceed to the reconstruction. We begin by determining regular sound correspondences between the dialects, and assigning these correspondences to phonemes in Proto-Atayal. After this we can start to reconstruct the vocabulary of Proto-Atayal, using sound correspondences to determine the appropriate protophonemes in each protoform. This stage also gives us the sound changes from Proto-Atayal to each individual dialect, which can later be used in subgrouping.

The reconstruction of lexical items should not be done in order to maximize the amount of protoforms. Some words were innovated during later stages, and these innovations also constitute subgrouping evidence. Here we need a very detailed database of cognates in all Atayal dialects in order to find lexical items that are uniquely shared between some dialects, but do not appear in others. We need to use external evidence to determine whether these uniquely shared etyma are lexical innovations or shared retentions. Such evidence may come from Seediq, a closely related language, or from Proto-Austronesian reconstructions: if an etymon is found in either and the sound correspondences are regular, then the corresponding etyma in Atayal are shared retentions. At the same time, we look for aberrant sound correspondences that are shared by two or more dialects. We then group the Atayal dialects according to lexical innovations and shared aberrations.

Care should be taken to separate shared lexical innovations from lexical borrowings. Vocabulary can be easily borrowed between related languages and dialects. The main diagnostic we use are irregular sound correspondences. If the sound correspondences are irregular, but phonetically similar to a dialect which is a likely source of lexical borrowing, then the word is likely a loan.

Finally, we combine the sound changes with shared lexical innovations and aberrations in order to determine a subgrouping. As long as the Comparative Method is applied cautiously, with borrowings whittled away, both the phonological and lexical evidence should be in agreement, giving us the correct subgrouping.

## Atayal dialects {#sec:dialects-intro}

This dissertation uses data from seven different Atayal dialects, listed below:

- Squliq
- S'uli
- Klesan (sometimes called C'uli')
- Matu'uwal (also called Mayrinax in earlier publications)
- Plngawan
- Skikun
- Matu'aw [called Matabalay in @li1981 and his other publications] 

Some of these dialects have been called by alternative names in past publications. In this dissertation, I use the preferred name used by the speakers of the dialect. Matu'uwal has often been called "Mayrinax" in linguistic literature [@li1980a;@huang1995;@liu2011], however this is an exonym used by Squliq speakers to refer to Matu'uwal. @li1981 referred to a "Matabalay" dialect using the name of the tribal village where he collected his data, but I instead opt for the more neutral name "Matu'aw", which is preferred by my language consultants. Klesan has been called "C'uli'" on the rare times it was mentioned in linguistic works [@li1998;@chen2011], however that term is ambiguous and easily confused with the *C'uli'* group from the subgrouping proposal by @utsurikawa1935. I use the name "Klesan", which is widely accepted by speakers of the dialect, and refers to the area around Nan'ao Township (南澳鄕) where they currently reside.

Linguistically speaking, no comprehensive list of distinct dialects of Atayal has ever been made. The Council of Indigenous Peoples currently holds language proficiency exams, provides wordlists and educational materials, etc., for six dialects. Matu'aw is not included in that list, and is often considered an aberrant variety of S'uli. However, in this dissertation I treat it as a separate dialect due to it lacking several crucial sound changes that occurred in S'uli. These sound changes are discussed in @sec:proto-atayal-to-dialects.

Some of the bigger dialects below show a degree of lexical and phonological variation between different communities, but remain mutually intelligible. I consider it unlikely that there are still 'undiscovered' Atayal dialects that have a low degree of mutual intelligibility with other Atayal communities.

The following sections introduce the seven dialects in this dissertation, their geographic position, and the village where my fieldwork was conducted. Phonologies of individual dialects are described in @sec:phonology.

### Squliq {#sec:squliq-intro}

Squliq Atayal (賽考利克泰雅語) is by far the biggest dialect in terms of the number of speakers and the geographic area it spans. It is spoken from southern New Taipei City in the north to northern Nantou County in the south, from Taoyuan, Hsinchu, and Miaoli Counties in the west to I-lan County in the east, spanning the Central Mountain Range.

Squliq is the de facto prestige dialect of Atayal, and is quite commonly understood by speakers of other dialects, whose communities often border Squliq villages. Plngawan is the exception to this tendency, since it is not bordered by any other Atayal dialect.

Being so big, Squliq naturally has a certain amount of lexical and phonological variation between villages, and also between individual speakers. For this reason I used data from various sources in my dissertation, including my own field notes, other linguists' data, and dictionaries. The phonological variations are not significant for the purposes of my research.

My fieldwork on Squliq was conducted in the Rahaw tribal village (溪口台部落) in Fuhsing Township, Taoyuan County, and in Slaq tribal village (水田部落) in Jianshih Township, Hsinchu County. I have also consulted Squliq speakers from several villages in Wufeng Township, Hsinchu County. Nevertheless, this field data was largely supplementary, and my main sources of lexical items were various Atayal dictionaries listed in @sec:sources-of-data.

### S'uli {#sec:suli-intro}

S'uli (澤敖利泰雅語) is the second biggest Atayal dialect. It is spoken in two distinct clusters: (1) Hsinchu County, with communities in both Jianshih and Wufeng Townships, (2) along the Da'an River (大安溪) between Miaoli County and Taichung City, with villages on both banks and further inland. These two S'uli-speaking areas are not only aware of each other, but maintain connections, with frequent intermarriage being the norm.

S'uli in both areas borders Squliq communities, though the Squliq presence in Hsinchu is a lot stronger. S'uli is spoken close to Matu'aw in Miaoli, and the communities interact with each other.

There are dialectal variations within S'uli, but these have not been actively studied. Matu'aw (introduced in @sec:matuaw-intro) is still considered a variety of S'uli, and I separated the two on the grounds of several major sound changes that I first saw in Li's [-@li1981;@li1982b] data and later confirmed with my own fieldwork. Despite these variations, S'uli speakers from different communities have no trouble communicating. Mutual intelligibility with Matu'aw is also very high.

I have conducted linguistic fieldwork in both clusters of S'uli: in Uwis tribal village in Wufeng Township, Hsinchu County (五峰鄉竹林村中興部落), and in several villages in Tai'an Township, Miaoli County.

### Klesan {#sec:klesan-intro}

Klesan (宜蘭澤敖利) is currently spoken in five tribal villages in Nan'ao Township, I-lan County, on the Pacific coast of Taiwan. This location is new: historically, the speakers of this dialect lived in the area around Nanhu Mountain (南湖大山), some 40 kilometres to the west and south of the current location and on the border of I-lan County and Taichung City. They were forcibly relocated in the first half of the 20th Century, during the period of Japanese rule in Taiwan. Currently, the villages where Klesan is spoken are: Pyahaw (碧候), Ropoy (金岳), Ləlaŋan/Buta (武塔), Iyu (東澳), Kəŋyan (金洋).^[These names come from my main language consultant in Pyahaw tribal village. @li1998 gives different names for some of them: Pyahaw (碧候), Ryuhiŋ (金岳), Mtlangan (武塔), Mkgugut (東澳), Knŋyan (金洋).]

Prior to their relocation, they would have been surrounded by Squliq and Truku Seediq speaking communities. Following the relocation, the dialect came under considerable influence from Japanese, which replaced native vocabulary that was preserved elsewhere.

I collected my data in Pyahaw tribal village (碧候部落). There are minor lexical and phonological differences among the five villages, but mutual intelligibility is not affected, and speakers are familiar with usage in other villages that differs from theirs.

### Matu'uwal

Matu'uwal (汶水泰雅語) is spoken in three villages in Tai'an Township, Miaoli County, along the Rinax River (汶水溪). It has been called "Mayrinax" in linguistic literature [@li1980a;@huang1995;@liu2011], which is an exonym. The speakers themselves prefer the name Matu'uwal, which has started to appear in recent publications [@huang2015;@huang2018].

Matu'uwal spoken in Qing'an Village (清安村) does not have the phoneme \<c\> /t͡s/, and merges it with /s/. The two phonemes are distinguished in Jinshui Village (錦水村), where I conducted my fieldwork.

Matu'uwal, more specifically the Qing'an Village variety, is bordered by Matu'aw to the south. There is a considerable amount of contact and intermarriage between the Matu'uwal community in Qing'an Village and their Matu'aw neighbours. Jinshui Village has a large Squliq presence due to the forced relocation of Squliq speakers during the period of Japanese rule. There is also a Hakka community to the west of Matu'uwal speaking villages, with whom they interact regularly. Many elderly Matu'uwal speakers are also proficient in Hakka.

Matu'uwal has received attention for preserving the gender register system that has been lost in other Atayal dialects [@li1982a;@li1983]. The gender register system is discussed in @sec:gender-register.

### Plngawan

Plngawan (萬大泰雅語) is spoken in a single village in Ren'ai Township, Nantou County. Historically there were three villages, which were relocated and merged into a single settlement by the Japanese in the first half of the 20th Century. The differences between the speech of the historical communities are minimal, and can only be observed in a handful of words [@chen2012, pp. 2-4].

Plngawan is an Atayal exclave: it is not bordered by any other Atayal dialect. Instead, it is surrounded by Seediq dialects, with whom they have historically maintained good relations, and Bunun, with whom the relationship has historically been one of animosity. Due to its close geographic proximity and prolonged contact with Seediq, Plngawan has a number of Seediq loanwords (@sec:borrowings-pl).

My Plngawan data comes from speakers in the Sasi tribal village (親愛部落).

### Skikun

Skikun (四季泰雅語) is spoken in at least two villages in Datong Township, I-lan County. The dialect takes its name from one of the villages that speak it: Skikun tribal village (四季部落). It is also spoken in Mnawyan tribal village (碼崙部落) to the north, as reported by @li1980.

The dialect is surrounded by Squliq to the north and south, and Squliq is also spoken across the mountains to the west, though I have not been able to identify any significant stratum of Squliq loanwords in Skikun.

My data was collected from speakers in Skikun tribal village.

### Matu'aw {#sec:matuaw-intro}

Matu'aw has received very little attention in linguistic literature. It has appeared in a couple of Paul Li's papers under the name "Matabalay" [@li1981;@li1982b], though he presented very little data and never explored it further. The name "Matabalay" refers to the name of the tribal village where Li collected his data.

Matu'aw is spoken in Daxing Village, Tai'an Township, Miaoli County (苗栗縣泰安鄉大興村). There are only two tribal villages where the dialect is spoken: Maymaralas (南灣) and Matabalay (榮安). The language in the two communities appears to be largely identical.

Matu'aw is bordered by Matu'uwal to the north (Qing'an Village), and by S'uli to the south and east. My fieldwork was conducted in Maymaralas tribal village.

## Sources of data {#sec:sources-of-data}

The majority of the Atayal data in this dissertation comes from my own fieldwork. I have been collecting linguistic materials on various Atayal dialects over the past seven years, though most of my initial work was on Matu'uwal.

The full wordlist for this dissertation is approximately 2000-2500 items long for each dialect and was collected from 2018 to early 2020. Unfortunately, the fieldwork on the S'uli and Matu'aw dialects was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and was not completed for fear of compromising the safety of the speakers and their communities. As such, there is less data on these two dialects in my dataset than planned. However, I do not expect the outcome of my research to change with more data, since even with a reduced dataset the tendencies in phonology and lexicon are already quite clear. A list of dialects and fieldwork locations is presented in @tbl:fieldwork-locations. More detailed information can be found in the relevant subsections of @sec:dialects-intro.

: Locations of fieldwork by dialect {#tbl:fieldwork-locations}

| Dialect   | Location of fieldwork                               |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Squliq    | various villages in Taoyuan City and Hsinchu County |
| Skikun    | Skikun tribal village, I-lan County                 |
| Matu'uwal | Jinshui Village (Caburuk), Miaoli County            |
| Plngawan  | Sasi tribal village, Nantou County                  |
| Klesan    | Pyahaw tribal village, I-lan County                 |
| S'uli     | various villages in Hsinchu and Miaoli Counties     |
| Matu'aw   | Maymaralas tribal village, Miaoli County            |

Squliq data was mostly sourced from dictionaries. This was done in part due to the availability of dictionaries (they only exist for the Squliq dialect), but also to avoid regional bias: the Squliq dialect is big, and regional variation in its vocabulary is more pronounced as a result. I sourced the Squliq data from the Council of Indigenous Peoples online dictionary^[https://e-dictionary.apc.gov.tw/Index.htm] and also checked it against print dictionaries [@ferrell1967;@egerod1980;@tesing2003] and my own field notes on Squliq. More information on Atayal dictionaries can be found in @sec:dictionaries.

Seediq data appears sporadically throughout the dissertation. It comes from two sources: Paul Li's publications, mostly @li1981; and the Council of Indigenous Peoples online dictionaries. The latter has separate dictionaries for the Seediq and Truku nations, which contain vocabulary in the Tgdaya and Truku dialects of the Seediq language, respectively.

<!-- Proto-Atayalic (not to be confused with Proto-Atayal) data is sourced from @li1981. -->
<!-- Actually I don't have much PAic data at all -->

Proto-Austronesian etyma are sourced from Blust and Trussel's Austronesian Comparative Dictionary (Blust and Trussel, ongoing).^[URL: https://www.trussel2.com/acd/, see also [@blust-trussel2013].] Due to the nature of the resource, some reconstructions therein are liable to change without notice. I sourced most of the etyma used in the dissertation during March of 2020. The only change I made to Blust's reconstructions was changing the orthography of Proto-Austronesian \*e to \*ə, in order to make its phonetic value as a mid central vowel more apparent.

## Orthographic conventions {#sec:orthography}

In order to make comparisons across various Atayal dialects and protolanguages more understandable and straightforward, I employ an orthographic system that combines some of the spelling conventions of Proto-Austronesian and Atayal while deviating from the IPA as little as possible. The main guiding principle is one symbol per phoneme, so all digraphs are eschewed. The full list of Atayal orthographic symbols as used in this dissertation is presented in @tbl:orthography.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Atayal orthography adopted here, and IPA equivalents}
\label{tbl:orthography}
\begin{tabular}{ l l|l l } \toprule
Grapheme & IPA & Grapheme & IPA \\ \midrule
p & [p]       & ŋ & [ŋ]    \\
t & [t]       & l & [l]    \\
k & [k]       & r & [ɾ\char`~r] \\

m & [m]       & ə & [ə]    \\
n & [n]       &   &        \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Most of the orthographic symbols are pronounced as their IPA equivalents. The main exceptions are \<y\> [j] and \<c\> [t͡s], which follow Proto-Austronesian and modern Atayal orthographic conventions. I decided to use \<y\> instead of \<j\> since the latter may be mistaken for the affricate [d͡ʒ] or confused with reflexes of Proto-Austronesian \*j (which is distinct from PAn \*y). Using \<c\> was motivated by the lack of a corresponding single symbol in the IPA as well as conventions in both Atayal and Proto-Austronesian, where the corresponding protophoneme is \*C.

Some orthographic symbols may have different allophonic pronunciations depending on the dialect, speaker, or phonological environment. The voiced obstruents \<b\> and \<g\> are more often fricatives, though they may surface as plosives in some dialects. The rhotic \<r\> is more commonly a tap, but can be realized as a trill and even occasionally as a fricative. The phonemes represented by \<c\> and \<s\> are palatalized before the high front vowel [i] and its corresponding glide [j], becoming [t͡ɕ] and [ɕ], respectively; this process is automatic and occurs in all Atayal dialects that have these phonemes.

I use **boldface** to mark affixation, for example Squliq ***m**uʔ* 'to shoot (AV)' and *b**un*** 'to shoot (PV)'. This is done because phonological processes may sometimes make morpheme boundaries fuzzy.

For more detailed descriptions of the phonologies of individual Atayal dialects, refer to @sec:phoneme-inventories-phonotactics.

## Organization of the dissertation

The structure of the dissertation is as follows. Chapter 2 presents a review of linguistic publications on Atayal. Chapter 3 provides a description of the synchronic phonologies of all seven Atayal dialects under research, including their phoneme inventories and phonotactics, as well as an overview of common synchronic phonological alternations.

The phonology of Proto-Atayal is discussed in Chapter 4, starting with sound correspondences for each protophoneme, then presenting the full phoneme inventory and phonotactics of the language. It also includes additional external evidence from closely related Seediq as well as from Proto-Austronesian reconstructions. Later sections list the sound changes from Proto-Atayal to each individual dialect, as well as the phoneme correspondences between Proto-Atayal and Proto-Atayalic, and also between Proto-Atayal and Proto-Austronesian.

Chapter 5 is concerned with the morphology and lexicon of Proto-Atayal, as well as the various lexical innovations and aberrations in its daughter dialects. It includes a reconstruction of the voice morphology in Proto-Atayal, and a description of the famous Atayal gender register system. The rest of the chapter is dedicated to lexical innovations and shared aberrations between Atayal dialects. A section on lexical borrowings between Atayalic varieties is included, and the final section presents external evidence, again from Seediq and Proto-Austronesian etyma.

Chapter 6 presents a linguistically motivated subgrouping of Atayal dialects. The subgrouping hypothesis is supported by phonological and lexical evidence at each node of the phylogenetic tree. Chapter 7 contains the summary, contribution of the dissertation, and directions for further research.

# Literature review {#sec:literature-review}

There are two main ways Atayal appears in linguistic literature. The first is literature on Atayal specifically, be it syntax, phonology, morphology, or other topics. This chapter is mainly concerned with publications of this first kind.

The second kind includes publications that are of a broader scope, usually typological or comparative works. Atayal data is sometimes included in these papers [@wolff1973;@ross1995;@blust1999a, etc.], but it is not the central point of the discussion.

There have been very few papers on the historical aspects of Atayal, mostly work done by Li on Proto-Atayalic [@li1981;@li1982b]. The status of the Atayalic subgroup as comprising Atayal and Seediq is clear and undisputed [@blust1999a, p. 46], which may be one of the reasons why so little work has been published on the historical linguistics of Atayal.

The remainder of the chapter lists all publications that focus on Atayal as the subject of research. The chapter is divided into sections by type of publication: peer-reviewed journal articles (@sec:journal-articles), master's theses and PhD dissertations (@sec:theses), dictionaries (@sec:dictionaries), and reference grammars (@sec:grammars).

## Journal articles and proceedings papers {#sec:journal-articles}

There has been a steady but relatively low amount of publications on the Atayal language over the years. All journal articles and conference papers on Atayal, or those that include Atayal among other languages under research, are listed in @tbl:prev-articles. The vast majority of articles have been on Squliq, the biggest dialect, with Matu'uwal coming in second due to its purported conservatism in both grammar and phonology. The remaining Atayal dialects are still woefully underresearched.

Most papers on Atayal have concentrated on its grammar (especially earlier works), morphosyntax, and syntax. Publications on Atayal phonology are few in comparison, almost all of them either by Li or H. Huang.

The first works on Atayal were written by Japanese linguist Naoyoshi Ogawa during the period of Japanese rule in Taiwan. Ogawa's first publication was on the structure of Atayal verbs [@ogawa1911]. He later also published an Atayal vocabulary [@ogawa1932]. Ogawa's *opus magnum* was his book on the myths and traditions of Formosan peoples, co-authored with Erin Asai [@ogawa1935]. This book presents a collection of myths in 12 different languages (Formosan and Yami), further subdivided by dialects, glossed in Japanese and including Japanese translations; with grammar sketches for each language. Ogawa included myths told in the Squliq and S'uli dialects in his book.

Ogawa's pioneering work was followed by Søren Egerod, who published papers on verb morphology [@egerod1965], the phoneme inventory [@egerod1966], word order and parts of speech [@egerod1966a]; as well as a wordlist [@egerod1965a] and an Atayal text with a vocabulary [@egerod1969]. Egerod later published an Atayal-English dictionary [@egerod1980]. All of Egerod's publications were on Squliq Atayal spoken in what is now Taoyuan City and New Taipei City.

L. Huang has published a large number of articles and books on several varieties of Atayal, mostly Squliq and Matu'uwal. @huang1994 is a look at ergativity in Squliq Atayal. @huang1995a is a comparison of Squliq and Matu'wal syntax. L. Huang co-authored several comparative papers with Elizabeth Zeitoun, Marie Meili Yeh, Anna Chang, and Joy Wu, where a variety of languages were examined, among them Matu'uwal and Squliq Atayal: on tense, aspect, and mood [@zeitoun1996], nominal case systems [@huang1998], negative constructions [@yeh1998], existential, possessive, and locative constructions [@zeitoun1999], pronominal systems [@huang1999], and interrogative constructions [@huang1999a]. @zeitoun2000 is a comparative study of the verbal derivation marker *ka-*, which includes Matu'uwal Atayal among the languages under comparison. L. Huang continued to write on different aspects of Matu'uwal syntax: its optative mood [@huang1996a], interrogative constructions [@huang1996], verb classification [@huang2000], focus system [@huang2001], and nominalization [@huang2002]. She published an analysis on the case marking system in Plngawan [@huang2006b] before returning to Squliq Atayal with studies on grammaticalization [@huang2008], the syntactic and semantic behaviour of the prefix *p-* [@huang2008a], and coordination and comitativity [@huang2011] in that dialect. In addition, Huang also wrote several grammars of Squliq and Matu'uwal Atayal, discussed below.

## Master's theses and PhD dissertations {#sec:theses}

In recent years, especially after the turn of the Century, there has been an increasing amount of master's degree theses and doctoral dissertations written on Atayal. All of them were written either at universities in Taiwan, or else by Taiwanese linguists pursuing their degrees abroad. Several linguists wrote both their master's thesis and PhD dissertation on Atayal. A number of these were written by native speakers of Atayal, and in such cases the topics tend to be of a more descriptive nature, or centered around the morphosyntax of the language.

Just like journal articles, theses and dissertations have been written almost exclusively on the Squliq and Matu'uwal dialects, with only a few exceptions. Students at National Tsinghua University account for most of the theses on Matu'uwal Atayal. The vast majority of thesis topics can be categorized as syntax or morphosyntax.

## Dictionaries and wordlists {#sec:dictionaries}

Several researchers have published wordlists or dictionaries, but only of Squliq Atayal. These are listed in @tbl:dictionaries.

@ogawa1932 was an early comprehensive Japanese-Atayal wordlist. It was later translated into English and republished by Raleigh Ferrell [-@ferrell1967]. Søren Egerod published an Atayal wordlist [@egerod1965a], but continued working on Atayal and collecting data, culminating in the first ever Atayal-English dictionary [@egerod1980]. This dictionary was later revised and posthumously re-released in 1999.

@tesing2003 is notable for being a monolingual Atayal-Atayal dictionary. Liao, also known as Tesing Silan in Atayal, later published an Atayal-Chinese dictionary [@tesing2014].

<!-- TODO: "different" -> who's behind it? -->
Apart from the aforementioned publications, several wordlists and dictionaries exist online or in digital form. The Council of Indigenous Peoples maintains online dictionaries for all 16 officially recognized nations, but opts for only the biggest dialect for each of them, this being Squliq in the case of Atayal.^[https://e-dictionary.apc.gov.tw/Index.htm] A different online dictionary includes S'uli as well as Squliq words.^[http://tayal.pqwasan.org.tw/kmal/desktop/index.php] The Council of Indigenous Peoples and the Indigenous Languages Research and Development Center also aid in the creation of 1000-word list for all dialects of every language, with six Atayal dialects represented: Squliq, Matu'uwal, S'uli, Skikun, Plngawan, and Klesan.

## Grammars {#sec:grammars}

Several grammars of Atayal have been published, but only on the Squliq and Matu'uwal dialects. All but one were authored or co-authored by L. Huang. @tbl:grammars presents a list of these. Apart from dedicated grammars, @ogawa1935 also includes a sketch grammar of Atayal.

Rau wrote her doctoral dissertation on the grammar of Squliq Atayal [-@rau1992], and later published it as a book. @huang1993 was another grammar of Squliq. @huang1995 was the first grammar of Matu'uwal, presenting the differences between this dialect and Seediq. Huang later published another grammar of Matu'uwal, this time in Chinese [@huang2000a]. Huang and Hayung [-@huang2016a; second edition -@huang2018a] is the latest grammar of Squliq Atayal, published by the Council of Indigenous Peoples as part of a series of grammars of the languages of all 16 officially recognized Formosan nations.

## Interim summary

There have been many studies on Atayal but the vast majority was focused on its morphosyntax. Squliq and Matu'uwal have received by far the most attention from linguists, to the detriment of other Atayal dialects.

There has been very little historical work done on Atayal. @li1981 reconstructed the phonology of Proto-Atayalic, which appears to have satisfied the linguistic community's interest. Blust [-@blust1999a, p. 46] writes, "The Atayalic subgroup is regarded as self-evident, and has been adequately demonstrated". And yet, no linguistic work has been done on the internal subgrouping of Atayal.

In this dissertation, I address issues that have previously received little attention. I provide synchronic phonological descriptions for seven Atayal dialects. I also talk in greater detail about the historical phonology of Proto-Atayal, and specifically address the issue of Atayal subgrouping.

# Phonologies of Atayal dialects {#sec:phonology}

This chapter presents a synchronic overview of the phonologies of the seven dialects discussed in the dissertation: Squliq, S'uli, Matu'uwal, Plngawan, Klesan, Skikun, and Matu'aw. Some of these, like Squliq and Matu'uwal, are comparatively well-researched. Others, like Klesan and Matu'aw, have received almost no attention in linguistic studies.

@sec:phoneme-inventories-phonotactics discusses the consonant inventories, vowel inventories, and phonotactics (syllable types, phoneme restrictions) of each dialect separately. @sec:synchronic-alternations discusses synchronic alternations in the different dialects together, in part because many of them are similar, and in part to provide a comparative overview.

## Phoneme inventories and phonotactics {#sec:phoneme-inventories-phonotactics}

The consonant inventories of the various Atayal dialects are mostly very similar to each other. The major differences are in the presence or absence of /q/ and \<c\> /t͡s/ phonemes, which in some dialects merge with /ʔ/ and /s/, respectively.

In the following sections, I will describe the consonant inventories of seven Atayal dialects separately, providing specifics of articulation where appropriate.

**Stress in all Atayal dialects in this study is always word-final**, and is not discussed separately for each dialect. It is realized as a pitch drop, and stressed syllables also have a higher intensity. Penultimate syllables tend to have a rising pitch in anticipation of the final pitch drop. I believe it is this rising pitch in penultimate syllables that led some linguists to occasionally hear penultimate stress, especially when pronounced in an utterance [@li1981, p. 239;@chen2011, p. 32].

### Squliq phonology {#sec:sq-phonology}

#### Squliq consonant inventory

Squliq is the biggest Atayal dialect in terms of the number of speakers and the geographical area over which it is spoken. There is inevitably a certain amount of phonetic variation in Squliq spoken in various geographically separate locations. Nevertheless, the differences between varieties of Squliq do not extend to the consonant inventory. @tbl:squliq-consonants presents the consonant phonemes of Squliq.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Squliq Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:squliq-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \toprule
p     & t        & k      & q     & ʔ     \\
b [v] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & c [t͡s]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
      & (z [ʑ])  &        &       &       \\
m     & n        & ŋ      &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Most varieties of Squliq preserves /q/ and /ʔ/ as separate phonemes. @li1998 did record several Squliq-speaking villages that have lost the /q/ phoneme, namely the tribal villages Kulu and Haga-Paris in I-lan County. The voiced labial obstruent /b/ is most often realized as a voiced labiodental fricative [v], but can also be a voiced bilabial fricative [β] in the speech of older and more conservative speakers.

The phoneme \<c\> /t͡s/ is not found in the dialect as a distinct root-internal phoneme, but coronal affricates can still appear in the dialect in several situations: (1) as an allophone of /t/ before the high front vowel /i/ or the palatal approximant \<y\> /j/, (2) as an allophone of /t/ in word-final position, and (3) in the derivational prefix *cə-* [@egerod1966, p. 123;@li1980, pp. 362-363].

In the first case, it is fully in complementary distribution with the plosive [t], and can be analyzed as an allophone of the phoneme /t/ directly preceding the vowel /i/ or the glide \<y\> /j/. Note that while orthographically it is still written as \<c\> /t͡s/, phonetically it is an alveolo-palatal affricate [t͡ɕ].

Word-final /t/ may also be affricated as [t͡s] in the speech of some Squliq speakers, and this is sometimes reflected in writing [@huang2016a, p. 12]. This is a purely phonetic feature and has no bearing on the phonological system of the dialect.

The derivational prefix *cə-* is what makes \<c\> /t͡s/ a phoneme. This prefix forms causative and reciprocal verbs, among other functions [@rau1992, pp. 102-104;@hayung2008, sec. 2.8]: e.g. *cə-* + *baq* 'to know' > ***cə**baq* 'to teach', *cə-* + *beŋ* 'to grasp' > ***cə**beŋ* 'to grasp each other'. Phonetically speaking, it is followed by a schwa vowel, so ***cə**baq* 'to teach' is pronounced [t͡sə.ˈvaq]. The prefix *cə-* contrasts with another derivational prefix *t-* [@hayung2008], so they cannot be analyzed as allophones here.

The status of \<z\>, phonetically a voiced alveolo-palatal fricative [ʑ], was addressed by @huang2015a, who examined its distribution relative to \<y\> /j/ in several varieties of Squliq. Huang's conclusion was that the two sounds are in complementary distribution in some varieties of Squliq, but minimally contrastive in others [@huang2015a, p. 254]. Even in varieties that show a distinction between \<z\> and \<y\> /j/, there are no minimal pairs, and the phonemic status of \<z\> remains marginal.

#### Squliq vowel inventory {#sec:squliq-vowels}

The vowel system of Squliq Atayal has traditionally been analyzed as /a i u e o/ [@egerod1966;@li1980;@huang2006a;@huang2016a]. The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ are much rarer than the vowels /i u a/, and they correspond to VG sequences \<ay\> /aj/ and /aw/ in some varieties of Squliq and other Atayal dialects [@li1980, pp. 354-355]. The high vowels /i/ and /u/ are centralized when adjacent to post-dorsal consonants /q/ and /h/, and may be perceived and written as mid vowels instead. <!-- TODO cite -->

On the other hand, almost no studies treat [ə] as a phoneme, and it is instead considered a purely phonetic vowel that breaks up underlying consonant clusters [@li1980, p. 355]. @yamada1974 do analyze it as a phoneme, but also note that its distribution is constrained to unstressed (non-final) syllables. @chien2001 presents data that constitutes near-minimal pairs of CG and CəG sequences, e.g. *hwa.h**un*** 'to destroy (PV)' vs *hə.wa.k**un*** 'to support by the arm (PV)'. @huang2014 treats these distinctions as stemming from glides being in the nucleus or the onset, but here I shall instead treat schwa as a marginal phoneme based on Chien's examples.

The vowel inventory of Squliq Atayal as analyzed here is presented in @tbl:squliq-vowels. The vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ are fully phonemic, while the central vowel /ə/ has a more limited distribution, and is treated as a marginal phoneme.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Squliq Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:squliq-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \toprule
i     &        & u     \\
e     & (ə)    & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This analysis is different from the commonly used analyses of the Squliq vowel system. The main difference is in the inclusion of /ə/, albeit as a quasi-phoneme due to its limited distribution: it is not able to receive stress and is the 'default' vowel that other vowels are lenited to. The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ can be analyzed as phonemic in some varieties of Squliq, but are absent from others [@li1980, pp. 354-355]. The varieties that do not have /e/ and /o/ phonemes will instead have VG or GV sequences in corresponding positions.

#### Squliq phonotactics

Squliq disallows true consonant clusters [@huang2006a]. Any apparent tautosyllabic consonant clusters have an intervening schwa vowel that is unwritten in the orthography of the language. Tautosyllabic CG sequences can be found, but are not consonant clusters: the glide in these sequences phonologically behaves like a vowel, and is therefore analyzed as part of the nucleus [@huang2006a, sec. 5].

The syllable types of Squliq Atayal are presented in @tbl:squliq-syllable-types. The table includes only those syllable types which are found across different varieties of Squliq. Some varieties allow more complex syllable structure, as discussed below.

: Syllable types in Squliq Atayal {#tbl:squliq-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss             |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| CV            | qu.tux  | 'one'             |
| CGV           | qwa.lax | 'rain'            |
| CVC           | baq     | 'to know'         |
| CGVC          | qwaw    | 'alcoholic drink' |

<!-- TODO: add syllable types that occur in part of Squliq variants -->
When open syllables occur word-finally, the vowel is lengthened, for example *bisuw* [vi.ˈsuː] 'worm'. These syllables can alternatively be analyzed as CVG with a homorganic glide coda [@huang2006a, p. 61]. The vowels in these syllables are limited to /i/ and /u/, and the syllables can only occur in word-final position. The vowel length in these syllables comes from an original consonantal coda, which lenited and is no longer found in Squliq [@li1981, sec. 2.8]. The same syllable type can be seen in all dialects of Atayal, with the same or similar origin (see @sec:consonant-correspondences for the origins of final long vowels).

There are variations in the phonotactics of Squliq in different regions. Huang [-@huang2006a, p. 66] notes that Taoshan Squliq allows root-internal codas and word-final CVGC syllables, but Jianshi Squliq does not. @tbl:squliq-syllable-types includes only syllable types found in all varieties of Squliq.

Some Squliq consonants have a limited distribution. The phoneme /x/ cannot occur word-initially [@li1981, p. 239]. The phonemes /b/ and /g/ cannot occur word-finally, and neither can the quasi-phoneme \<z\> [ʑ] [@li1981, p. 240]. @li1981 also claims that /r/ was disallowed in word-final position in Squliq, but Huang [-@huang2006a, p. 64] lists several counterexamples with word-final /r/ in Taoshan Squliq. Even though /r/ can appear word-finally, it is extremely rare in this position, and is replaced with /l/ by some speakers.

The voiceless dental plosive /t/ is affricated before a high front vowel /i/ or the corresponding glide \<y\> /j/, as seen in @tbl:squliq-t-affrication.

: Affrication of /t/ in Squliq {#tbl:squliq-t-affrication}

| Word   | Transcription | Gloss   |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| cimuʔ  | [t͡ɕi.ˈmuʔ]    | 'salt'  |
| cyugal | [t͡ɕu.ˈɣal]    | 'three' |

This behaviour can be analyzed as an allophone of the phoneme /t/, or as the phoneme \<c\> /t͡s/ occurring in complementary distribution with /t/ in this environment. Diachronically speaking, /t/ is in the middle of a split, so both interpretations are possible at this time.

The phoneme /k/ followed by /q/ or /h/ in the same word in other dialects, in Squliq corresponds to /q/ instead. In other words, Squliq tends to avoid /k..q/ or /k..h/ sequences in the same word, though they are not disallowed entirely. See examples in @tbl:dorsal-harmony-squliq [from @li1980, p. 377].

: Dorsal harmony in Squliq {#tbl:dorsal-harmony-squliq}

| Squliq  | S'uli   | Matu'uwal | Gloss        |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| qəhuniq | kahuniʔ | kahuniq   | 'tree'       |
| qətəhuy | katahuy | kithuw    | 'fat, thick' |

Both words in Squliq have an initial /q/ phoneme, but begin with a /k/ in both S'uli and Matu'uwal. The final phoneme in 'tree' is /q/ in Squliq and Matu'uwal, and /ʔ/ in S'uli, which is the regular correspondence. Squliq underwent a process called *dorsal consonant harmony*, whereby a historical *k was backed into /q/ in some environments (see @sec:proto-atayal-to-sq for more information). This process also occurred in Skikun [@li1980, p. 377] and Seediq [@lee2009].

Some Squliq speakers do not allow /l/ to occur in word-final position, and replace it with /n/ [@rau2000]. This is a sound change in progress; it has not yet completed for all Squliq speakers. This merger can also be found in other Atayal dialects, see @sec:merger-final-l-n.

Squliq, like several other Atayal dialects, has a vowel weakening rule under which all vowel distinctions outside the rightmost foot are lost [@egerod1965, p. 255-257;@li1980, pp. 369-370]. This weakening rule is demonstrated in @sec:prepen-vowel-weakening. Put another way, this rule means that no vowels other than schwa can occur anywhere except the final two syllables. One exception in native Atayal vocabulary is the perfective infix *-in-* in some varieties of Squliq, where it retains its vowel regardless of its position within a word. Another exception is the interjection *talagay* 'wow!', which has a cardinal vowel in the third-to-last syllable.

### S'uli phonology

#### S'uli consonant inventory

S'uli is the second biggest Atayal dialect, and is spoken in Jianshih Township and Wufeng Township in Hsinchu County (新竹縣尖石鄉、新竹縣五峰鄉), Tai'an tonwnship in Miaoli County (苗栗縣泰安鄉), and Heping district in Taichung City (台中市和平區). Its consonant inventory, shown in @tbl:suli-consonants, is characterized by the lack of both /q/ and \<c\> /t͡s/ phonemes.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{S'uli Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:suli-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \toprule
p     & t        & k      &       & ʔ     \\
b [v] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ŋ      &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

S'uli has a voiced alveolo-palatal fricative [ʑ], which in my data is in complementary distribution with the glide [j]. These two sounds are likely allophones of \<y\> /j/, but no research has been done on a possible phonemic distinction between the two. Here they are treated as allophones, but still distinguished in transcription.

The lateral approximant /l/ does not appear word-finally in S'uli due to a merger with /n/ in this position (see @sec:merger-final-l-n).

There is some variation within S'uli, but due to frequent intermarriage between different S'uli communities, it is not always easy to identify language features on a geographic basis. They are instead treated as individual speaker variations. Indeed, often speakers will provide two forms upon elicitation, either with variant pronunciation or else different lexical items, both of which can be used by S'uli speakers.

One such variation is an affricate [t͡ɕ] allophone of /t/ before the high front vowel /i/ or the corresponding semivowel \<y\> /j/. Thus, the word 'salt' may be pronounced variously as *cimu* or *timu*, sometimes by the same speaker. Some speakers are very consistent with a single variant, for others the consistency may vary by lexical item. However, due to the large amount of variation between speakers, we cannot yet analyze this phenomenon as a phonemic split, though it could become one in the future.

#### S'uli vowel inventory

The vowel inventory of Squliq Atayal is shown in @tbl:suli-vowels. There is variation between speakers, which is explained in more detail below.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{S'uli Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:suli-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \toprule
i     &        & u     \\
(e)   & (ə)    & (o)   \\
      & a      &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The mid vowels [e] and [o] appear in the speech of some speakers, but not others. For example, the word 'eye' can be pronounced *rawzi*, *rowzi*, or *rozi*, with a range of [aw\~ow\~o] for the relevant sounds. This means that, depending on the speaker or variety, there may or may not be mid vowels /e/ and /o/ in the vowel inventory.

The vowel schwa does appear in the surface representation in the dialects that I have studied, however here there is also some variation. There appears to be some crossover with the vowel /a/, and sometimes the difference between the two is not very audible. Very often the pronunciation was in the range of [ɐ], that is, somewhere between a low and a central position, with the mouth more open than for a central vowel, but less so than for a stressed /a/ for the same speaker.
<!-- TODO: rethink this, because maybe [zya] (eg in *hzyan*) counts -->
<!-- One possible way to argue for a distinction is by observing their distribution relative to allophones of \<y\> /j/: for example, in the word [ʑə.ma.ˈɣan] 'five' we see the [ʑ] realization, which does not occur before /a/. -->

#### S'uli phonotactics {#sec:suli-phonotactics}

The syllable types common to all S'uli varieties are shown in @tbl:suli-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in S'uli Atayal {#tbl:suli-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss             |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| CV            | ʔu.tux  | 'one'             |
| CGV           | kya.hin | 'skin'            |
| CVC           | la.tan  | 'clothing'        |
| CGVC          | sway    | 'younger sibling' |

Some speakers have CVGC syllables, e.g. *rawm* 'needle', while other speakers coalesce the VG sequence into a mid vowel, as in *rom*.

Closed syllables are allowed in non-final positions, e.g. *l**əm**ŋaluŋ* 'to think (AV)', *kəbhəni* 'bird'. Not all third-to-last vowels are deleted, cf. *məkərakis* 'young woman'.

S'uli (at least for some speakers) has a contrast between *nya* (3S.Gen clitic pronoun) and *niya* (proximal progressive marker), where the presence or absence of a homorganic vowel before a glide is phonemic. I have not encountered such distinctions in other Atayal dialects.

Unlike most Atayal dialects, S'uli does not distinguish open final syllables from final syllables ending in a glottal stop, i.e. there are no phonemic glottal stops in word-final position. Words that end with a phonemic /ʔ/ or /q/ in other dialects do not reliably show an audible glottal stop in my consultants' speech: *tari* 'knee', *kisi* 'k.o. basket', *rozi* 'eye'. The only other Atayal dialect with the same phenomenon is Klesan (see @sec:culi-phonotactics).

### Matu'uwal phonology

#### Matu'uwal consonant inventory

Matu'uwal Atayal, spoken in three Villages in Tai'an Township, Miaoli County, has been described by researchers as 'conservative' [@li1981, p. 236;@huang2000, p. 364]. While this descriptor is overly broad, it is true for some aspects of its phonology, including its consonant inventory, shown in @tbl:matuuwal-consonants.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'uwal Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:matuuwal-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \toprule
p     & t        & k      & q     & ʔ     \\
b [β] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & c [t͡s]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ŋ      &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Matu'uwal preserves historical /q/ and \<c\> /t͡s/ as separate phonemes, and is one of only two Atayal dialects to do so (the other being Skikun). Older speakers of Matu'uwal use the voiced bilabial fricative [β] pronunciation of the phoneme /b/. Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that allows the phonemes /b/ and /g/ to occur word-finally, see @sec:matuuwal-phonotactics for more details.

Matu'uwal spoken in Qing'an Village (清安村) lacks the phoneme \<c\> /t͡s/, and it completely merged with /s/. My data comes from speakers in Jinshui Village (錦水村), whose dialect preserves the contrast between \<c\> /t͡s/ and /s/.

#### Matu'uwal vowel inventory

The vowel inventory of Matu'uwal is simpler than that of other dialects. @tbl:matuuwal-vowels presents the vowels of Matu'uwal.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'uwal Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:matuuwal-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \toprule
i     &        & u     \\
      & (ə)    &       \\
      & a      &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Unlike most other Atayal dialects, Matu'uwal does not have any occurrences of mid vowels [e] and [o] in native vocabulary (though they may occur in Japanese or Sinitic loanwords). Instead, Matu'uwal will have VG sequences \<ay\> /aj/ and /aw/ or hiatuses /ai/ and /au/ where other dialects have mid vowels. @sec:matuuwal-phonotactics goes into more detail on Matu'uwal hiatuses.

Like Squliq, Matu'uwal allows the mid central vowel to occur in the surface representation, but it is quite rare. Matu'uwal does not reduce all prepenultimate vowels, and preserves vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, although it does have vowel reductions of a different kind, see @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng. Its appearance is restricted to the initial open syllables, e.g. *bəhut* 'squirrel'.

#### Matu'uwal phonotactics {#sec:matuuwal-phonotactics}

Matu'uwal syllables are maximally CVC [@huang2015, pp. 58-59]. The full range of syllable types is rather small, and presented in @tbl:matuuwal-syllable-types.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Syllable types in Matu'uwal Atayal}
\label{tbl:matuuwal-syllable-types}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l } \toprule
Syllable type & Example & Gloss     \\ \midrule \addlinespace
CV            & qu.tux  & `one'     \\ \addlinespace
VC            & ra.an   & `road'    \\ \addlinespace
CVC           & baq     & `to know' \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Just like in other Atayal dialects, the vowel in final open syllables is lengthened. Unlike other Atayal dialects, this vowel can be /a/, e.g. *taka* [ta.ˈkaː] 'frog, toad'. This makes it impossible to analyze final open syllables as having an underlying homorganic glide coda, since [a] does not have a corresponding glide [@huang2015, p. 61]. Open syllables in Matu'uwal are mostly due to the deletion of word-final Proto-Atayal \*ɹ (see @sec:consonant-correspondences for more details).

Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that allows onsetless syllables, but these can only occur in word-final position. Like final open syllables, Matu'uwal **hiatuses**, or vowel clusters, are the result of the loss of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ. Hiatuses can be either two identical vowels (/a.a/, /i.i/, /u.u/), or a vowel sequence with decreasing sonority (/a.i/, /a.u/). Phonetically, these hiatuses are distinct from VG sequences: there are two audible syllable peaks; and stress, which is always word-final in all Atayal dialects, falls on the second vowel. The reason for this analysis is the difference in phonological behaviour between these two sets, see @sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution for a detailed explanation.

Some studies describe CGVC or CVGC syllables in Matu'uwal [@lu2005], but here I agree with Huang [-@huang2015, p. 59] in analyzing them as disyllabic sequences CV.GVC or CV.VC, e.g. *quwaw* 'wine' is syllabified as /qu.waw/, and *rauq* 'earth, ground' as /ra.uq/.

Matu'uwal allows closed syllables to occur anywhere within the word instead of limiting them to word-final position: for example, ***mi**ckackaʔ* 'between' is syllabified as /mit͡s.kat͡s.kaʔ/, consisting of three closed syllables.

Matu'uwal consonants are less restricted in their distribution than in other Atayal dialects. Matu'uwal allows both /b/ and /g/ to occur in word-final position: *h**um**ab* 'to stab (AV)', *bicug* 'worm'. The affricate \<c\> /t͡s/ cannot occur word-finally: it merges with /t/, as detailed in @sec:merger-final-c-t.

Unlike most Atayal dialects, Matu'uwal does allow /x/ to occur in word-initial position. Li [-@li1981, p. 240] identifies only two lexical items with initial /x/, *xuwil* 'dog' and *xuxuʔ* 'breasts', and I have not encountered any other examples. Note that this limited distribution is also found in closely related Seediq: the only word with word-initial /x/ in all Seediq dialects in *xiluy* 'iron' [@li1981, p. 240;@lee2010, p. 137].

Matu'uwal does not lenite all prepenultimate vowels, unlike Squliq, S'uli, Klesan, and Skikun. It preserves vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, as shown in @tbl:matuuwal-antepenult-vowels.

: Vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable in Matu'uwal {#tbl:matuuwal-antepenult-vowels}

| Matu'uwal   | Gloss            |
|-------------|------------------|
| t**a**ŋuqiy | 'horn'           |
| p**i**saniq | 'taboo'          |
| t**u**rakis | 'foxtail millet' |

There are still vowel reduction processes of a different nature in Matu'uwal, which are discussed in [@sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution; @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng].

Schwa in Matu'uwal appears almost exclusively in initial open syllables: *bəhut* 'squirrel', *kəgiy* 'hemp', *həmaʔ* 'tongue'. There are very rare exceptions to this tendency: ***man**təhawnak* 'to sit (AV)', *s**um**anmənahuqil* 'to kill (AV)'; but in these cases the syllable carrying the schwa immediately follows a morpheme boundary. Usually a word-medial schwa is deleted, leading to a non-final closed syllable; this is addressed in @sec:historical-schwa-alternations.

### Plngawan phonology

#### Plngawan consonant inventory {#sec:plngawan-consonants}

Plngawan Atayal is spoken in a single tribal village in Ren'ai Township, Nantou County (南投縣仁愛鄉). There used to be three separate villages all speaking the same dialect, but they were relocated to their current location in the first half of the 20th Century, during Japanese rule. Differences between subdialects do exist, but are mostly lexical, and do not extend to the consonant inventory [@chen2012, pp. 2-4].

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Plngawan Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:plngawan-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \toprule
p     & t        & k      &       & ʔ     \\
b [b\char`~β] &        & g [g\char`~ɣ] &       &       \\
      & c [t͡s]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h     &       \\
m     & n        & ŋ      &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j], ɹ &        &       &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Plngawan lacks a /q/ phoneme, but preserves the distinction between /s/ and \<c\> /t͡s/. It is the only dialect to have an alveolar approximant phoneme /ɹ/ distinct from other approximants. This phoneme contrasts with /r/, phonetically an alveolar tap, or more rarely a trill. Both phonemes have no restrictions on where in a word they can appear.

Plngawan voiced obstruents /b/ and /g/ may be realized as either plosives [b] and [g] or fricatives [β] and [ɣ], respectively. The fricative pronunciation tends to occur in intervocalic position. Li [-@li1985, p. 700] writes that all Atayal dialects except Plngawan pronounce /b/ and /g/ as fricatives, however in my fieldwork I have also encountered plosive pronunciations from speakers of Klesan (@sec:culi-consonants) and Skikun (@sec:skikun-consonants).

The phoneme /h/ is not as strongly pharyngeal as in other Atayal dialects, and appears to be merging with /x/. During my fieldwork, I noticed that the difference between /h/ and /x/ is not always very clear, and /h/ is sometimes pronounced as a velar fricative [x], especially before high or mid vowels. The speakers themselves do not always differentiate between them reliably. The two phonemes are more clearly distinguished in word-final position. The phoneme /h/ can also be realized as a pharyngeal [ħ] or glottal fricative [h].

The alveolar approximant /ɹ/ in word-final position may sometimes be realized as [l], merging with /l/. This does not happen consistently, even for the same speaker.

#### Plngawan vowel inventory

Plngawan has a five-vowel inventory, shown in @tbl:plngawan-vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Plngawan Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:plngawan-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \toprule
i     &        & u     \\
e     &        & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ occur in Plngawan quite frequently, in part due to widespread vowel coalescence (@sec:vowel-coalescence). Schwa does not appear in this dialect, and instances of historical schwa were merged into cardinal vowels (most frequently /a/, but also others), or were deleted. See @sec:historical-schwa-alternations for more information on alternations of historical schwa.

#### Plngawan phonotactics {#sec:plngawan-phonotactics}

Plngawan has a relatively simple syllable structure, as shown in examples in @tbl:plngawan-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in Plngawan Atayal {#tbl:plngawan-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| CV            | ʔu.tux  | 'one'     |
| CVC           | baʔ     | 'to know' |
| CGVC          | ryuŋ    | 'hornet'  |

Chen [-@chen2012, p. 24] lists examples with onsetless syllables, such as /ra.gi.il/ 'narrow', /hu.la.i/ 'snow', and /ba.i/ 'thyroid gland' (notation modified). In my fieldwork, I heard clear glottal stops in the elicitation of all these examples, so they should be transcribed instead as /ɹagiʔil/ [ɹa.ɣi.ˈʔil]^[Chen has an initial /r/ in her transcription, but this word should start with /ɹ/ instead.] 'narrow', /hulaʔi/ [hu.la.ˈʔiː] 'snow', and /baʔi/ [ba.ˈʔiː]'thyroid gland'. Conversely, Chen writes /sa.ʔiŋ/ 'two', where the glottal stop appears to be optional in my data. However, unlike Matu'uwal (@sec:matuuwal-phonotactics), Plngawan has no phonemic distinction between a hiatus and two vowels with an intervening glottal stop, so I analyze all these examples as having a phonemic glottal stop.

There are very few good examples of CGVC syllables, with the best one given in @tbl:plngawan-syllable-types. I have not been able to find any examples at all with the approximants /w/ and /ɹ/ in my dataset, so the glide in this syllable type appears to be limited to \<y\> /j/. Chen's [-@chen2012, p. 24] examples /ta.ra.hjaʔ/ 'to lie down' and /si.njuw/ 'rope' can alternatively be analyzed as /ta.rah.jaʔ/ and /sin.juw/, respectively, with the syllable boundary between the consonant and the glide. Examples with the phonemes \<c\> /t͡s/ or /s/ such as Chen's /ʔu.cjux/ [ʔu.ˈt͡ɕux] 'fish' are not pronounced as two separate segments, but instead coalesce into a single palatal segment [t͡ɕ] or [ɕ], respectively. Underlyingly, they should still be treated as separate phonemes based on alternations such as *s**um**yuw* [sumjuː] 'to make rope (AV)' vs *syug**un*** [ɕuɣun] 'to make rope (PV.SBJV)'. This pair shows that /s/ and \<y\> /j/ are separate phonemes based on the position of the infix *-um-*: if there were a distinct phoneme \<sy\> /ɕ/, we would expect the infixed form to be \*\**syumuw*. In the suffixed form *syug**un***, the phonemes /s/ and \<y\> /j/ are phonetically merged into a single segment [ɕ], and thus belong in the same syllable.

Plngawan preserves vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, as shown in @tbl:plngawan-antepenult-vowels. These vowels are often the same as in Matu'uwal, though sometimes they are not; these differences are explored further in @sec:prepenult-vowel-correspondences.

: Vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable in Plngawan {#tbl:plngawan-antepenult-vowels}

| Plngawan    | Gloss            |
|-------------|------------------|
| n**a**karit | 'spider'         |
| p**i**saniʔ | 'taboo'          |
| t**u**rakis | 'foxtail millet' |

Vowels outside the head foot do get reduced in Plngawan under certain circumstances, this is discussed in @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng.

Chen [-@chen2012, p. 3] notes that one of the main differences between the Macagis and Samiru subdialects of Plngawan is their syllable structure: Samiru allows heterosyllabic consonant clusters, while Macagis has an intervening /a/ vowel in these words, e.g. Samiru *kilkah* vs Macagis *kilakah* 'kick'. The vowel is always /a/, and Chen treats it as an epenthetic vowel in Macagis in order to avoid a heterosyllabic CC cluster, i.e. Macagis disallows non-final CVC syllables. My analysis is that this difference is caused by a difference in sound changes of \*ə in this environment, see @sec:historical-schwa-alternations.

<!-- ʔ cannot appear in word-internal codas -->

Word-final \<ay\> /aj/ is very rare, because Plngawan underwent a change whereby Proto-Atayal \*ay became /iː/ word-finally (see @sec:proto-atayal-to-pl). It can be found in a few words, such as *cubay* 'very much, truly' or *kakumay* 'caterpillar'.

<!-- TODO: word-final bilabials > velars -->

I have collected some examples of what appear to be syllabic nasals in Plngawan. The dialect has a derivational prefix *m-* which is used in agentive nominalizations, e.g. ***m**pulataʔ* 'hunter', ***m**pumaɹah* 'farmer', ***m**pakuriʔ* 'thief', ***m**purahuʔ* 'shaman'. This prefix is pronounced as a separate syllable, but the mouth remains fully closed for the entire duration. This phenomenon would benefit from further investigation.

### Klesan phonology

#### Klesan consonant inventory {#sec:culi-consonants}

The consonant inventory of Klesan is given in @tbl:culi-consonants. This dialect does not have /q/ as a phoneme, but distinguishes \<c\> /t͡s/ and /s/.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Klesan Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:culi-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \toprule
p     & t        & k      &       & ʔ     \\
b [β] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & c [t͡s]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ŋ      &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Klesan does not allow bilabial consonants /b/, /m/, or /p/ to appear in word-final position. This is discussed in @sec:merger-labial-velar.

Likewise, /l/ does not occur word-finally either in my dataset, see @sec:merger-final-l-n for more details. It should be noted that my data comes from Pyahaw tribal village (碧候), one of five tribal villages where Klesan is spoken. @li1998 includes data from all five villages, and in his data Ropoy (金岳) and Kəŋyan (金洋) do have final /l/, so this is not common to all Klesan speakers.^[In Li's paper, the villages are called Ryuhiŋ (金岳) and Knŋyan (金洋), respectively.]

The phoneme /k/ may be backed by some speakers. Its phonetic realization is sometimes uvular [q], but not consistently. There is only one dorsal plosive phoneme in Klesan, but its pronunciation may vary.

The voiced obstruents /b/ and /g/ are normally pronounced as voiced fricatives [β] (or [v]) and [ɣ], respectively. This was assumed to be true for all Atayal dialects with the exception of Plngawan [@li1981;@li1985]. However I did notice and record plosive variants [b] and [g] in Klesan as well as Skikun (see @sec:skikun-consonants).

#### Klesan vowel inventory

Klesan distinguishes five vowel phonemes plus a quasi-phonemic schwa, as shown in @tbl:culi-vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Klesan Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:culi-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \toprule
i     &        & u     \\
e     & (ə)    & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Schwa cannot appear in the final (stressed) syllable, but is allowed everywhere else. The cardinal vowel phonemes /a i u e o/ normally only appear in final syllables or in penultimate open syllables, though they are sometimes allowed in other positions, e.g. in reduplicated monosyllables or in loanwords. The distribution of schwa is not completely predictable. These issues are explored further in @sec:culi-phonotactics.

#### Klesan phonotactics {#sec:culi-phonotactics}

Klesan allows both closed and open syllables in final and non-final positions, although non-final closed syllables do have some restrictions, as discussed further below. Syllables are maximally CGVC, and all syllable types with examples can be seen in @tbl:culi-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in Klesan Atayal {#tbl:culi-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss       |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| CV            | ma.su   | 'to finish' |
| CVC           | bes     | 'spouse'    |
| CGV           | mya.sa  | 'good'      |
| CGVC          | lwax    | 'pillar'    |

Non-final closed syllables are allowed in Klesan, though they are not common. Apart from reduplicated onomatopoetic words (*pyongpyoŋ* 'hare', *bengbeŋ* 'cricket') and loanwords (***mə**zyungbaŋ* 'to prepare', from Japanese 準備 *junbi*), the vowel in these syllables will always be a schwa, as demonstrated in @tbl:nonfinal-closed-syll-culi.

: Non-final closed syllables in Klesan {#tbl:nonfinal-closed-syll-culi}

| Klesan       | Gloss                   |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| hək.ha.ni    | 'to look for'           |
| məs.tə.na    | 'to meet, to encounter' |
| məs.lə.pyuŋ  | 'to befriend'           |
| sə.mə.ʔa.tuʔ | 'head cold'             |

In ***məs**təna* 'to meet' and ***məs**ləpyuŋ* 'to befriend', *məs-* is a derivational prefix that indicates a change of state; but *həkhani* 'to look for' does not appear to have any affixation. The latter suggests that heterosyllabic consonant clusters are not limited to morpheme boundaries. In all of the aforementioned three words, the closed syllable is third-to-last, which may suggest a vowel syncope rule in the environment VC\_CV. This hypothesis is disproved by the example *s**əm**əʔatuʔ* 'head cold', which shows that a schwa can appear in such a position. This means that the distribution of schwa in Klesan may not be fully predictable. The problem of the distribution of schwa in Klesan will not be addressed further in this dissertation, but it does merit further research.
<!-- It can also appear as *məsə-*, for example in *məsəsya* 'to melt' (from *ʔəsya* 'water')
Or is the schwa here part of the root? Can't tell. -->

Klesan differentiates between monosyllabic CG sequences and those with an intervening schwa vowel, e.g. the near minimal pair [sə.nə.wa] 'loud' and [sə.nwan] 'to face something'. This phenomenon appears similar to one found in Squliq, as described in @sec:squliq-vowels.

There is also a partial merger of /n/ or /l/ with /ŋ/ in word-final position in my data. This has not been reported in previous publications, but my language consultant sometimes merged a final /n/ or /l/ into /ŋ/ when it was preceded by the vowel /i/: Klesan *kyabiŋ* 'swallow (bird sp.)', cf. Squliq and Skikun *kyabil*; Klesan *səbiŋ* 'lunchbox', cf. Matu'uwal and Squliq *səbil*. This is not consistent, and other words do show final /in/, e.g. *kənerin* 'woman', *yamin* 'footwear', *kyahin* 'skin'. This does mean that in my dataset, Klesan will sometimes have a final /ŋ/ where an /n/ would be expected.

Klesan only has vowel distinctions in the final two syllables in its native vocabulary. This is a feature common to several Atayal dialects, and is discussed at length in @sec:prepen-vowel-weakening.

As in S'uli (@sec:suli-phonotactics), the functional load of final glottal stops in Klesan appears to be greatly reduced, if it exists at all. My language consultant failed to perceive any distinction between words that are expected to have final glottal stops and words that are expected to have final open syllables (based on cognates with other Atayal dialects). On one occasion, the speaker insisted on a long vowel in a word where a final glottal stop would be expected, e.g. [la.ʔiː] 'child', cf. Matu'uwal *ʔulaqiʔ*, Squliq *ʔəlaqiʔ*, Skikun *laqiʔ*, Matu'aw *ʔulaʔiʔ*, Plngawan *ʔuleʔ*. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no audible glottal stop nor any noticeable vowel lengthening in such words. Therefore, I treat Klesan as having final open syllables and no word-final glottal stops.

### Skikun phonology

#### Skikun consonant inventory {#sec:skikun-consonants}

The consonant inventory of Skikun is presented in @tbl:skikun-consonants. The phonemes /x/ and /g/, marked with asterisks in the table, may be undergoing a merger, see discussion further below.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Skikun Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:skikun-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \toprule
p     & t        & k      & q     & ʔ     \\
b [b\char`~β] &  & g\text{*} [ɣ] &       &       \\
      & c [t͡s]   &        &       &       \\
      & s        & x\text{*}    & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ŋ      &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Paul Li [-@li1980, p. 375] notes as early as 40 years ago that Skikun /g/ may be devoiced into [x] before consonants and is always voiceless in word-final position (identified as historical \*g using comparisons with other dialects). Chen [-@chen2011, p. 26] notes word-initial devoicing as well, although she analyzes it as instances of word-initial /x/. In my own fieldwork, I noticed this pronunciation and more: /g/ tends to be devoiced word-initially, and /x/ tends to be voiced intervocalically. As such, there may be no reason to posit /g/ and /x/ as separate phonemes if they are no longer meaningfully distinguished in the language. However, this dissertation will not address the issue further. The reader should be aware that any difference between /g/ and /x/ in Skikun is **unreliable** and subject to variation.

The phonemes /n/ and /l/ are not always differentiated in word-final position. My language consultant was mostly consistent with expected reflexes, but occasionally either hypercorrected /n/ to /l/ (e.g. *rawil* 'cousin' instead of expected \*\**rawin*) or hypocorrected /l/ to /n/ (e.g. \*\****m**əxan* 'to be sick, to be in pain' instead of expected ***m**əxal*, cf. suffixed form *kəxalun* 'to hurt'). This is most likely part of a larger trend to merge word-final /l/ into /n/, which is common among younger Atayal speakers of various dialects.

I also noticed a variant pronunciation of the phoneme /b/ during my fieldwork. Normally it is pronounced as either a voiced bilabial fricative [β] or a labiodental one [v], as was assumed to be the case throughout Atayal with the exception of Plngawan [@li1981;@li1985]. I have recorded /b/ pronounced as a voiced bilabial plosive [b] word-initially in some words in Skikun and Klesan (see @sec:culi-consonants).

#### Skikun vowel inventory

Skikun Atayal has the same vowel inventory as Squliq and Klesan, including mid vowels and a quasi-phonemic schwa, shown in @tbl:skikun-vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Skikun Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:skikun-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \toprule
i     &        & u     \\
e     & (ə)    & o     \\
      & a      &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The mid vowels /e/ and /o/ are rarer than the vowels /a i u/. As in other Atayal dialects that have them, they mostly come from the monophthongization of historical diphthongs \<ay\> /aj/ and /aw/.

As in all Atayal dialects, schwa does not occur in the final (stressed) syllable, but can occur anywhere else. Its distribution is further discussed in the next section.

#### Skikun phonotactics {#sec:skikun-phonotactics}

The syllable types allowed in Skikun are very similar to those that are common to Squliq. They are presented in @tbl:skikun-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in Skikun Atayal {#tbl:skikun-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example | Gloss     |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| CV            | qu.tux  | 'one'     |
| CGV           | qwa.lax | 'rain'    |
| CVC           | baq     | 'to know' |
| CGVC          | byaq    | 'worm'    |

Schwa is pervasive in Skikun, and follows every consonant that does not have a following cardinal vowel. As such, non-final closed syllables in Skikun are only allowed on morpheme boundaries, for example using the perfective infix *-in-*: *kinholan* 'place of origin, home village'.^[There is at least one content word in the native vocabulary that appears to violate this principle: *kinpahux* 'pit viper'. Skikun does have a verbal root *pahux* 'to snap, to break', so *kinpahux* in the meaning of 'pit viper' can be argued to be a derived form, albeit with no traceable semantic link.] Other affixes that can form a closed syllable include *cin-* (multiple meanings), *kin-* 'extremely', *min-* 'N times'.

<!-- TODO: mquti' vs quci' - palatalization may not be full or automatic. discuss ti > ci in any case -->

The only word-final open syllables in Skikun are those with the vowel /i/, where it undergoes compensatory lengthening: *bənaqiy* 'sand', *həlaqiy* 'snow'. Words that have a final long /u/ in Squliq will instead end in /x/ in Skikun, e.g. Squliq *sənyuw* vs Skikun *sənyux* 'rope'. This is due to different changes of historical \*g (see @sec:consonant-correspondences).

### Matu'aw phonology

#### Matu'aw consonant inventory

Matu'aw is spoken in two tribal villages in Ta-hsing Village, Tai'an Township, Miaoli County (苗栗縣泰安鄉大興村). The consonant inventory of Matu'aw is characterized by the lack of both \<c\> /t͡s/ and /q/ phonemes, just like its neighbouring S'uli dialect. It is shown in full in @tbl:matuaw-consonants.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'aw Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:matuaw-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \toprule
p     & t        & k      &       & ʔ     \\
b [β] &          & g [ɣ]  &       &       \\
      & s        & x      & h [ħ] &       \\
m     & n        & ŋ      &       &       \\
      & l, r     &        &       &       \\
w     & y [j]    &        &       &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Unlike S'uli, Matu'aw \<y\> /j/ does not have a [ʑ] allophone before the vowel /i/, and in this environment it is still pronounced as a palatal approximant [j] or more emphatically, a voiced palatal fricative [ʝ].

Matu'aw /t/ does not affricate before /i/, and is pronounced as [t] in all environments, e.g. *timuʔ* 'salt'.

The lateral /l/ can appear in word-final position in Matu'aw, for example in the words *kanayril* 'woman' and *ʔitayal* '(Atayal) person'.

Word-final glottal stops are highly audible in Matu'aw, even after diphthongs in words like *wawʔ* 'pigeon', *kayʔ* 'language, speech', and *balayʔ* 'good'. These syllable types are also discussed further in @sec:matuaw-phonotactics.

#### Matu'aw vowel inventory {#sec:matuaw-vowels}

The vowel inventory of Matu'aw is a simple three vowel system, shown in @tbl:matuaw-vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Matu'aw Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:matuaw-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \toprule
i     &        & u     \\
      &        &       \\
      & a      &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Matu'aw does not have mid vowels, and preserves diphthongs instead. Schwa does not appear in the surface representation, and all instances of penultimate schwa in other dialects correspond to /a/ in Matu'aw, as shown in @tbl:matuaw-penult-schwa.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Correspondences of penultimate schwa in Matu'aw}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These correspondences will be explored in depth in Chapter 4.
<!-- TODO: add proper link? -->

#### Matu'aw phonotactics {#sec:matuaw-phonotactics}

Matu'aw allows a relatively high number of syllable types, shown in @tbl:matuaw-syllable-types. The maximum syllable is CGVC or CVGC.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Syllable types in Matu'aw Atayal}
\label{tbl:matuaw-syllable-types}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l } \toprule
Syllable type & Example   & Gloss             \\ \midrule \addlinespace
CV            & tu.la.ʔiy & `eel'             \\ \addlinespace
CVC           & yi.luk    & `strawberry'      \\ \addlinespace
CGV           & kwa.ra    & `all'             \\ \addlinespace
CGVC          & ʔwaw      & `alcoholic drink' \\ \addlinespace
CVGC          & wawʔ      & `pigeon'          \\ \addlinespace
CGVGC         & sa.swayʔ  & `younger sibling' \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Syllables of the type CVGC are auditorily different from hiatuses in Matu'uwal. In Matu'uwal, the word 'needle' is pronounced [ra.ˈum], with two distinct syllable peaks and stress on the vowel /u/. On the other hand, the Matu'aw cognate [rawm] is pronounced as a single syllable with stress falling on the vowel /a/. Since stress in Atayal is invariably word-final, this allows us to analyze the Matu'aw word as monosyllabic, with the syllable type CVGC.

Matu'aw preserves vowel distinctions outside the final foot, like Matu'uwal and Plngawan. Some examples are shown in @tbl:matuaw-antepenult-vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable in Matu'aw}
\label{tbl:matuaw-antepenult-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ l l } \toprule
Matu'aw     & Gloss    \\ \midrule \addlinespace
h\textbf{a}puniʔ & `fire'   \\ \addlinespace
ʔ\textbf{i}tayal & `person' \\ \addlinespace
t\textbf{u}laʔiy & `eel'    \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The third-to-last vowels may be somewhat unstable: my main language consultant would occasionally offer two or even three variants before settling on a vowel. There may be many factors at play, and I cannot judge whether this indicates the state of the language, interference from other dialects, or lack of practice with competent speakers. I have noticed a tendency among younger speakers to reduce prepenultimate vowels to /a/, although I have not conducted interviews to see how widespread this is. All of this being said, Matu'aw agrees with Matu'uwal on the third-to-last vowel in cognates, and by and large agrees with Plngawan as well. These correspondences are discussed in detail in @sec:prepenult-vowel-correspondences.

There is a tendency in Matu'aw to avoid non-final closed syllables (i.e. heterosyllabic consonant clusters). @tbl:matuaw-cluster-avoidance shows a few examples of closed syllables in Matu'uwal and Plngawan, and corresponding Matu'aw cognates. The vowel in these cases is always /a/.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Tautomorphemic consonant cluster avoidance in Matu'aw}
\label{tbl:matuaw-cluster-avoidance}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l } \toprule
Matu'aw   & Matu'uwal & Plngawan & Gloss          \\ \midrule \addlinespace
yakalit   & akliʔ     & ɹaklit   & `leopard'      \\ \addlinespace
kabahaniʔ & kabahniq  & kabahniʔ & `bird'         \\ \addlinespace
ʔalatiŋ   & qaltiŋ    & ʔaltiŋ   & `wooden plank' \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This tendency is less strict on morpheme boundaries, where closed syllables can and do occur: /t**um**.sa.sa.liʔ/ 'to build a house' (< *saliʔ* 'house'), /k**um**.ka.gi/ 'to strip bark from hemp, to decorticate' (< *kagiy* 'hemp, ramie').

Li [-@li1981;@li1982b] recorded word-final /g/ in his fieldwork on the Matu'aw dialect in Matabalay tribal village. In my fieldwork, I found no instances of word-final /g/, and the words that were expected to have it instead ended with an open syllable, as shown in @tbl:matuaw-final-g-comparison.

: Comparison of Li's and my own Matu'aw data on final /g/ {#tbl:matuaw-final-g-comparison}

| Li's data (circa 1980) | My data (2020) | Gloss             |
|------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| siniyug                | sinyuw         | 'rope'            |
| tulaʔig                | tulaʔiy        | 'eel'             |
| bunaʔig                | bunaʔiy        | 'sand'            |
| **ma**bazig            | **ma**bayiy    | 'to buy'          |
| kagig                  | kagiy          | 'hemp'            |
| s**um**amag            | s**um**amaw    | 'to make the bed' |
| ʔarag                  | ʔaraw          | 'ribs'            |

There is no reason to doubt the veracity of Li's data, as his expertise in linguistic fieldwork has been proved with decades of meticulous research on Formosan languages, Atayal chief among them. Moreover, comparative data from Seediq dialects [@li1981;@li1982b] does point to a historical \*g in these words. What happened here is that Li managed to record this sound when he was doing his fieldwork forty years ago, and it has since disappeared from Matu'aw. The most conservative speakers that I can interview in 2020 were young and innovative when Li was conducting his research.

In fact, Li [-@li1982, sec. 2.2.1] says as much when he mentiones that younger speakers in Matabalay tribal village tended to replace the final /g/ with /w/ or \<y\> /j/ depending on the vowel. A native speaker from Matabalay tribal village who was 50 years old in 1980 had already completely lost final /g/, and only Li's 63 year old consultant (at the time of his fieldwork) still retained it.

Word-initial /x/ can be found in at least one word in Matu'aw: *xuyil* 'dog', compare Matu'uwal *xuwil*, but Squliq *huzil*, S'uli *huzin*, Plngawan *huɹil*. Since even Matu'uwal only has two words with initial /x/, the other being *xuxuʔ* 'breasts', for which no Matu'aw cognate exists, this may be the only occurrence of word-initial /x/ in the dialect.

## Synchronic alternations {#sec:synchronic-alternations}

There are numerous synchronic phonological alternations in both consonants and vowels in Atayal dialects. Some of these are common to many dialects, while others are restricted to just one or two.

The sound alternations that are shared between various dialects can be either inherited from Proto-Atayal or be the result of linguistic drift, whereby a sound change occurs separately in different dialects. The two cases are relatively easy to distinguish with the comparative data at hand. Instances of both the inherited alternations and drift-induced alternations are given in this section. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but it includes the major alternations that can be found in various Atayal dialects.

### Consonant alternations {#sec:consonant-alternations}

#### Devoicing and lenition of final voiced obstruents {#sec:final-devoicing}

Discounting the quasi-phonemic [ʑ] in Squliq, which is almost entirely in complementary distribution with \<y\> /j/, there are two voiced obstruent phonemes in all varieties of Atayal: /b/ and /g/. Only Matu'uwal allows them to occur in word-final position, and we will compare data from other dialects with Matu'uwal cognates.

I have not been able to find a single cognate set that demonstrates this for all seven dialects in this study, so I will use multiple correspondence sets instead. The devoicing of /b/ in Squliq and Skikun is shown in @tbl:b-devoi-sq-sk.

: Alternations of final /b/ in Squliq and Skikun {#tbl:b-devoi-sq-sk}

| Matu'uwal  | Squliq      | Skikun      | Gloss                    |
|------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| h**um**gub | h**əm**əgup | h**əm**əgup | 'to perform a rite (AV)' |
| hagb**an** | həbəg**an** | həgup**an** | 'to perform a rite (PV)' |
| h**um**ab  | h**əm**ap   | h**əm**ap   | 'to stab (AV)'           |
| hab**un**  | hab**aw**   | hab**un**   | 'to stab (PV)'           |

Several things of note are happening in this table. There are vowel alternations in both Matu'uwal and Squliq, which are discussed in detail in @sec:historical-schwa-alternations. The Squliq PV form *həbəg**an*** also undergoes sporadic metathesis of the consonants /b/ and /g/ (we would expect \*\**həgəban* here instead). Squliq *hab**aw*** is the irrealis PV form, with the suffix *-aw*. And lastly, Skikun does not exhibit consonant or vowel alternation in *h**əm**əgup~həgup**an*** 'to perform a rite', and instead regularizes the verb. This sort of paradigm leveling is common in Skikun, see @sec:paradigm-leveling for more examples. Nevertheless, some verbs do still retain consonant alternations, as shown in the pair *h**əm**ap~hab**un*** 'to stab'.

Li [-@li1981, p. 251;-@li1982b, pp. 174-175] finds only five cognates shared between various Atayal dialects including Matu'uwal, plus another two items which do not have a Matu'uwal cognate, but have an alternating /b/ appearing in suffixed forms. I have not found any data other than what Li has, although some of my data is slightly different, possibly due to dialectal variation or language change. The five cognates with historical final \*b are shown in @tbl:final-b-devoicing.

: Final /b/ devoicing in various Atayal dialects {#tbl:final-b-devoicing}

| Matu'uwal   | Squliq      | Skikun      | Plngawan     | Klesan        | Gloss              |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------------|

| h**um**gub  | h**əm**əgup | h**əm**əgup | **m**pahuk   | **mə**həguk   | 'to perform rites' |
| **ma**suwag | **mə**suyap | **mə**suyak | **ma**suɹak  | **pə**suyak   | 'to yawn'          |

Li [-@li1982b, p. 174] has Plngawan *h**um**uk~hub**an*** 'to perform rites' (his gloss is 'to do magic'), but I have only been able to elicit ***m**pahuk~**si**pahuk* 'to scry, to divine'.^[Note the lack of a vowel after the first consonant in ***m**pahuk*. This is my transcription of what appears to be a syllabic nasal used as a derivational prefix, see @sec:plngawan-phonotactics for more information.] The Plngawan verb form 'to perform rites/magic' is ***m**urahuʔ~parah**on***, according to my fieldwork. Nevertheless, ***m**pahuk* from my data is still a cognate, just with different affixation.

Matu'aw also has /b/ devoice to /p/ in word-final position, e.g. *g**um**awp* 'to share a cup (AV)' vs the suffixed form *gawb**aw*** 'to share a cup (PV.SBJV)'.

In Plngawan and Klesan, the phoneme alternating with /b/ is not /p/, but rather /k/. Note that the same happens for only a single item in Skikun (in my data). This is due to another sound change whereby labials merge into velars in final position, discussed further in @sec:merger-labial-velar.

Matu'uwal ***ma**suwag* 'to yawn' has final /g/ instead of the expected /b/. Li [-@li1981, p. 252] notes that he did record the alternative pronunciation ***ma**suwab* from some speakers, and also gives the locative voice form *syab**an*** in Squliq [@li1980, p. 358], so the change to /g/ in Matu'uwal must have been a later innovation.

Unlike /b/, the phoneme /g/ is not devoiced in most dialects, with the exception of Skikun. Instead, it is lenited to the semivowel /w/, as seen in @tbl:final-g-lenition.

: Final /g/ lenition in various Atayal dialects {#tbl:final-g-lenition}

| Matu'uwal   | Squliq      | Skikun      | Plngawan    | Klesan      | Gloss              |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| s**um**amag | s**əm**amaw | s**əm**amax | s**um**amaw | s**əm**amaw | 'to make bed (AV)' |
| samag**an** | səmag**an** | səmax**an** | samag**an** | səmag**i**  | 'to make bed (LV)' |
| l**um**pug  | l**əm**əpuw | l**əm**əpux | l**um**puw  | l**əm**əpu  | 'to count (AV)'    |
| lapg**un**  | ləpəg**un** | ləpəg**un** | lapg**an**  | ləpəg**un** | 'to count (PV/LV)' |

Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that still preserves /g/ in word-final position after the vowels /a/ and /u/ (it does not appear after /i/). Skikun preserves its fricative features, but devoices it word-finally. In all other dialects, it becomes /w/, which is most apparent after the low vowel /a/. When preceded by /u/, it is realized as vowel lengthening, but is typically written as \<uw\>.

When these verbs are suffixed, for example with the PV suffix *-un* or the LV suffix *-an*, the underlying /g/ phoneme surfaces. Note that I have *səmax**an*** for Skikun 'to make the bed (LV)', this is likely due to an ongoing merger between the phonemes /x/ and /g/ in the dialect (see @sec:skikun-consonants).

Li [-@li1981;@li1982b] reports final /g/ in Matu'aw wherever Matu'uwal had it, and also where it did not, namely after the vowel /i/. However, I did not find any examples of final /g/ during my fieldwork on Matu'aw, and it was instead reflected as /w/ after the vowel /a/ and as vowel length after high vowels, see also @sec:matuaw-phonotactics.

There are no examples of root-final /g/ alternations before the vowel /i/. This is most likely due to a sound change from Proto-Atayalic to Proto-Atayal in this environment. This correspondence led @li1981 to reconstruct the protophoneme \*g' in Proto-Atayalic, which is discussed in @sec:li-proto-atayalic-g.

#### Final labial to velar merger {#sec:merger-labial-velar}

Plngawan and Klesan disallow final labials completely. If a verbal root has an underlying labial in final position, it will become a velar instead, and the labial only emerges in suffixed forms. @tbl:merger-labial-velar demonstrates the correspondence of final labials in other Atayal dialects to final velars in Plngawan and Klesan.

| Plngawan     | Klesan      | Matu'uwal     | Squliq      | Skikun      | Gloss              |

| **ma**loɹak  | **mə**luyak | q**um**aluwap | q**əm**alup | q**əm**alup | 'to hunt'          |

| roŋ          | roŋ         | raum          | rom         | rom         | 'needle'           |
| ɹuhuŋ        | yuhuŋ       | ʔuhum         | yuhum       | yuhum       | 'gallbladder'      |
| c**um**oŋ    | c**əm**oŋ   | c**um**aum    | s**əm**om   | c**əm**om   | 'to wipe'          |

S'uli and Matu'aw also allow final labials to occur, e.g. S'uli *ʔ**əm**lyap*, Matu'aw ***ma**lyap* 'to hunt'; S'uli ***pə**nep*, Matu'aw ***pa**nayp* 'to fish'; S'uli *y**əm**up*, Matu'aw *ʔ**um**yup* 'to blow'; S'uli *rom*, Matu'aw *rawm* 'needle'; S'uli and Matu'aw *yuhum* 'gallbladder'. My Skikun data has final labials in most words where other dialects have them, though in some words they become velars, for example ***mə**suyak* 'to yawn', cf. Squliq and S'uli ***mə**suyap*. This was noted by Li [-@li1980, pp. 379-381] in his studies, when he recorded various degrees of neutralization of final labials in Skikun, depending on the speaker. Younger speakers tended to neutralize the labials in more words, and this is also true for other ongoing sound changes. In my data, this only happens in a very limited amount of lexical items.

Plngawan and Klesan thus have consonant alternations between labials and velars, as shown in @tbl:pl-cu-labial-velar-altns.

: Labial to velar alternations in Plngawan and Klesan {#tbl:pl-cu-labial-velar-altns}

| Plngawan  | Klesan    | Gloss          |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| y**um**uk | y**əm**uk | 'to blow (AV)' |
| yup**an** | yup**an** | 'to blow (LV)' |
| c**um**oŋ | c**əm**oŋ | 'to wipe (AV)' |
| com**an** | com**an** | 'to wipe (LV)' |

The labials /p/ and /m/ surface when the verb is suffixed, but not when the segment is word-final. There are exceptions as well, for example the Plngawan verbs ***ma**loɹak* 'to hunt (AV)' and ***pa**nek* 'to fish (AV)' do not have this alternation in my data, and retain the velar when suffixed. This is discussed in @sec:paradigm-leveling.

Notably, both Plngawan and Klesan are spoken close to the Truku dialect of Seediq, which has the same merger of final labials and velars [@tsukida2005, pp. 293-294].^[Klesan is currently not geographically adjacent to Seediq, but this is due to their relocation in the early 20th century, as mentioned in @sec:klesan-intro.] It is possible that this merger was spread due to language contact.

#### Alternation between *-c-* and *-t* {#sec:merger-final-c-t}

This merger concerns alternations in verbal roots, namely suffixed and unsuffixed forms. There exists a different phenomenon in Atayal, where the phoneme /t/ is affricated into [t͡s] in word-final position for some speakers. This occurs in various dialects [@li1982, sec. 2.4.1;@chen2011, p. 25;@chen2012, p. 14;@huang2016a, p. 12], but in this case there is no phonemic distinction, and the effect is purely phonetic.

@tbl:c-t-alternation-contrast demonstrates the contrast between alternating and non-alternating verbs in five Atayal dialects, using cognate forms. The infixed forms have identical final consonants, but the suffixed forms have separate phonemes preceding the suffix in Matu'uwal and Plngawan, though there is no distinction in Klesan, Squliq, or Skikun.

: Contrast between alternating and non-alternating forms in several Atayal dialects {#tbl:c-t-alternation-contrast}

| Matu'uwal | Plngawan  | Klesan    | Squliq    | Skikun    | Gloss          |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| k**um**at | k**um**at | k**əm**at | k**əm**at | k**əm**at | 'to bite (AV)' |
| kac**un** | kac**un** | kat**un** | kat**un** | kat**un** | 'to bite (PV)' |
| k**um**ut | k**um**ut | k**əm**ut | k**əm**ut | k**əm**ut | 'to cut (AV)'  |
| kut**an** | kut**an** | kut**an** | kut**an** | kut**an** | 'to cut (LV)'  |

Both S'uli and Matu'aw have this alternation as well, though in these two dialects, /t/ alternates with /s/ due to a merger between Proto-Atayal \*c and \*s. For example, Matu'aw *y**um**iŋat\~yiŋas**un*** : Matu'uwal *ʔ**um**iŋat\~ʔiŋac**un*** : Skikun ***m**iŋat\~ŋat**un*** 'to rob'. S'uli has *ʔəlis**an*** 'to peel (LV)', cf. Plngawan *ʔ**um**alit\~ʔalic**un***, Klesan ***m**ilit\~lit**un***.

The regularity of these alternations between Matu'uwal, Plngawan, S'uli, and Matu'aw, as well as a complete lack of any conditioning environment, mean that these alternations were inherited from a common ancestor rather than innovated separately. On the other hand, Klesan, Squliq, and Skikun must have regularized these alternating verbs into non-alternating forms, thus losing the contrast. For more information on the regularization processes in Atayal, see @sec:paradigm-leveling.

#### Alternation between /l/ and /n/ {#sec:merger-final-l-n}

The merger of final /l/ and /n/ is, on the one hand, characteristic of certain dialects, but on the other hand commonly found in the speech of younger speakers all across the Atayal community. It can be described as an ongoing sound change, with some dialect communities being further along in the merger than others.

This merger is characteristic of some varieties of S'uli and Klesan, as demonstrated in @tbl:suli-culi-final-l-n-merger. Matu'uwal, Plngawan, and Matu'aw all preserve the phonemic distinction between /l/ and /n/ in word-final position, but it is neutralized in my S'uli and Klesan data.

: Final /l/ and /n/ merger in S'uli and Klesan {#tbl:suli-culi-final-l-n-merger}

| S'uli   | Klesan  | Matu'uwal | Plngawan | Matu'aw | Gloss     |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| yamin   | yamin   | wamil     | (sapit)  | yayamil | 'shoes'   |
| huzin   | hoyin   | xuwil     | huɹil    | xuyil   | 'dog'     |
| tayan   | tayan   | ʔitaal    | ʔitaɹal  | ʔitayal | 'Atayal'  |
| yupun   | yupun   | ʔawpun    | (ʔaraʔ)  | yayupun | 'pants'   |
| ləhəbun | ləhəbun | lalihbun  | lahbun   | lahabun | 'stomach' |

There appear to be Klesan dialects that still allow word-final /l/. @li1998 provides a wordlist, where some lexical items from the Ropoy (金岳) and Kəŋyan (金洋) tribal villages have final /l/, although neither dataset is fully consistent, meaning that the change was already underway when Li was collecting his data.

Speakers of other dialects may exhibit this merger as well. It is pervasive in the speech of younger Atayal in many different villages [@li1982, sec. 2.3]. For any given speaker, the merger may be total, or manifest itself in only part of the vocabulary [@rau2000].

For those dialects or speakers with the final /l/ to /n/ merger, verbal roots will show alternations like those in @tbl:l-n-alternations.

: /l\~n/ alternations in S'uli and Klesan {#tbl:l-n-alternations}

| S'uli       | Klesan      | Gloss              |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| k**əm**ayan | k**əm**ayan | 'to speak (AV)'    |
| kyal**un**  | kyal**an**  | 'to speak (PV/LV)' |
| **m**agan   | **m**agan   | 'to take (AV)'     |
| gal**un**   | gal**un**   | 'to take (PV)'     |
| s**əm**əbin | s**əm**əbin | 'to leave (AV)'    |
| səbil**an** | səbil**un** | 'to leave (PV/LV)' |

The underlying representation of verbal roots can thus be determined by examining suffixed forms. I have not yet come across cases of regularization of this particular alternation, perhaps because it is still relatively new. Despite the short timeframe, it has managed to spread throughout the Atayal-speaking territory.

#### Other alternations {#sec:other-consonant-alternations}

<!-- add alternations of Plngawan ɹ (where it gets deleted)? -->
<!-- No. Too hard for now. -->
There are other, less common consonantal alternations that can be found in one or more dialects. Two of these are of particular interest in this dissertation, and are discussed below.

Some verbs that have a final /s/ in the root that appears only in suffixed forms. @li1980 identifies several such verbs, which are listed in @tbl:root-final-s-alternations (entries marked with an asterisk are taken from Li's paper, the rest are from my own field notes).

| Matu'uwal          | Plngawan     | Squliq             | Matu'aw          | Skikun         | Gloss                    |

| r**um**ahiy        |              | **m**ahiy          | r**um**ahiy      | r**əm**ahis\*  | 'to dry in the air (AV)' |
| rahis**an**        |              | hir**an**          | rarahis**an**    | rəhis**an**\*  | 'to dry in the air (LV)' |

|                    | pager**an**  | pəgyar**an**       |                  | pəgyas**an**   | 'to run away (LV)'       |

In Plngawan and Squliq the alternating consonant is /r/ instead. This is due to a rhotacism rule in both these dialects, where /s/ changes to /r/ in some environments, see [@sec:proto-atayal-to-sq;@sec:proto-atayal-to-pl] for more details. Note that Skikun has final /s/ in AV forms of all four verbs. This is due to paradigm leveling in the dialect, which happens with many other alternations as well, see @sec:paradigm-leveling for more information.

The Matu'aw verbs originally had final /g/ in the AV forms of the three verbs in the table, as recorded by Li [-@li1980, p. 385]. He gives ***ma**bazig* 'to buy (AV)', *r**um**ahig* 'to dry in the air (AV)', and *k**um**akagig* 'to strip hemp (AV)'.

However, not all verbs with a final long /iː/ have this alternation: cf. Matu'uwal ***m**ahiy\~bahiy**un***, Plngawan ***m**ahiy\~bahy**an***, Squliq ***m**ihiy\~bəhy**un***, Klesan ***m**ahiy\~bəhy**un*** 'to hit, to beat'. It is thus root-specific, and limited to only a few words.

Another even more specific alternation is a final glottal stop /ʔ/ alternating with /l/ in suffixed forms. There are very few words with this alternation, shown in @tbl:gs-l-alternation. The forms marked with asterisks are taken from Shih [-@shih2008, p. 16], Chen [-@chen2012, p. 137], and Egerod [-@egerod1965, p. 262], the rest come from my own field notes.

: Alternation of /ʔ/ and /l/ in Atayal dialects {#tbl:gs-l-alternation}

|               | **ma**haʔ\*   |              |              |            | 'to go (AV)' |
|               | hal**an**\*   |              |              | hal**an**  | 'to go (LV)' |

I found the Plngawan verb ***ma**haʔ\~hal**an*** in Shih's and Chen's theses. It is unclear how it differs from ***m**usaʔ*, since both are glossed as 'to go'. When conducting fieldwork on Klesan, I elicited the forms *sal**an*** and *hal**an*** for 'to go (LV)', with apparently the same meaning, but I did not come across the AV form of *hal**an***. Whether the two verbal roots are related (possibly through an irregular sound change with later borrowing) remains to be determined, but so far there is no evidence for this.

Note that unlike other dialects, the Squliq forms *ʔəs**an*** 'to go (LV)' and *swaʔ**un*** 'how (PV)' are regular, without an alternating /l/. This is a later innovation in Squliq, which regularized many of its irregular verbs. See @sec:paradigm-leveling for more information on this regularization phenomenon.

The Matu'uwal word *h**um**icuwaʔ* 'how' and its cognates in other dialects are special, because it is a wh-word but it is also marked for Austronesian voice morphology, which occurs only in verbs. It serves as the main predicate in sentences where it appears, but non-AV forms are rare. I have elicited a PV form in Matu'uwal (*həcuwal**un***) and found a PV form for Plngawan (*hacol**un***) in @shih2008 and @chen2012. Both the Matu'uwal and Plngawan suffixed forms have an alternating /l/ phoneme, and I expect other dialects to have the same behaviour in cognates.

### Vowel alternations

#### Prepenultimate vowel weakening {#sec:prepen-vowel-weakening}

One of the most common phonological phenomena in Atayal dialects is vowel weakening outside the rightmost foot. In dialects with this type of vowel weakening, only the last two syllables of a word may have phonemic vowel distinctions, and all preceding syllables may only have a reduced vowel (usually a schwa but sometimes /a/, depending on the dialect and the speaker). This phenomenon can be readily observed through verbal roots that can attach suffixes (such as PV *-un* or LV *-an*), and is demonstrated in @tbl:prepen-vowel-weakening.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Prepenultimate vowel weakening in various Atayal dialects}
\label{tbl:prepen-vowel-weakening}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l } \toprule
Dialect & Bare stem & Suffixed form & Gloss       \\ \midrule \addlinespace
Squliq  & qalup     & qəlup\textbf{un}   & 'to hunt'   \\ \addlinespace
Skikun  & hakut     & həkut\textbf{un}   & 'to move'   \\ \addlinespace
S'uli   & ʔasuw     & ʔəsug\textbf{un}   & 'to divide' \\ \addlinespace
Klesan  & piray     & pəray\textbf{un}   & 'to turn'   \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Prepenultimate vowel weakening occurs in the four dialects in @tbl:prepen-vowel-weakening, namely Squliq, Skikun, S'uli, and Klesan. Egerod [-@egerod1965, pp. 255-257] and Li [-@li1980, pp. 369-371] describe this alternation for Squliq, but it works the same in the other three dialects. It affects nouns as well, but there are no suffixes that attach to nouns (unless the same root can also serve as a verb), so in nominal-only roots the vowel weakening process can only be observed indirectly, as a distribution restriction. This restriction is that vowel contrasts only appear in the final two syllables (with a few exceptions discussed below).

There are some exceptions to this rule. Some loanwords and a few native words still preserve cardinal vowels outside the final two syllables. Several examples are given in @tbl:vowel-weakening-exceptions.

: Exceptions to the vowel weakening rule {#tbl:vowel-weakening-exceptions}

| Dialect | Word    | Gloss                     |
|---------|---------|---------------------------|
| Squliq  | betunux | 'beautiful'               |
| Skikun  | qarapiʔ | 'black drongo (bird sp.)' |
| S'uli   | cicini  | 'stag beetle'             |
| Klesan  | icikoŋ  | 'click beetle'            |

All the words in the table appear to be native (I am reasonably certain they did not originate in Sinitic languages or Japanese), but all have a cardinal vowel in the third-to-last syllable. However, such words are quite rare.

Recent loanwords tend to preserve vowels outside the head foot as well, for example, Klesan *petangko* 'light-vented bulbul (bird sp.)', likely from Southern Min 白頭鵠仔 *pe̍h-thâu-khok-á*, and *sirasagi* 'egret', from Japanese 白鷺 *shirasagi*.

Lastly, some derivational affixes like the perfective infix *-in-* are not subject to vowel weakening in the dialects where they occur, for example S'uli *r**in**muʔiy* 'roof' (cf. ***sə**rəmuʔiy* 'to construct a roof (IV)'), Squliq *p**in**qəzyw**an*** 'story' (cf. *pəqəzyuʔ* 'to tell'), Skikun *m**in**əbes* 'to have bought' (cf. ***m**es* 'to buy (AV)').

Note that the AV infix *-əm-* and the AV prefix *mə-* in Squliq, Skikun, S'uli, and Klesan are **not** instances of the vowel reduction rule applying to an underlying form with a cardinal vowel. We can see this by looking at monosyllabic roots with this infix, where prepenultimate weakening does not apply. In such forms, the infix still has a schwa vowel: e.g. *k**əm**at* 'to bite (AV)' or *k**əm**ut* 'to cut (AV)', identical in all four dialects.

#### Alternations of historical schwa {#sec:historical-schwa-alternations}

Another type of alternations, common to all dialects of Atayal, are the alternations of a historical schwa vowel in verbal roots. As mentioned in @sec:phoneme-inventories-phonotactics, no Atayal dialect allows the vowel schwa to appear in the final (stressed) syllable, if it is allowed to occur in the dialect at all. This alternation was first noted and descibed for Squliq by Egerod [-@egerod1965, pp. 257-258], but it works very similarly in all Atayal dialects due to its origins in the protolanguage (see @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics).

If this alternating vowel occurs in the final syllable of the root, it surfaces as /u/ when the root is not suffixed, such as in bare stem forms, or infixed forms. If it is followed by a suffix, the vowel is lenited. This process can be seen in @tbl:root-final-schwa-alternations.

: Alternations of historical schwa in root-final syllables {#tbl:root-final-schwa-alternations}

| Dialect   | AV form     | Suffixed form | Gloss           |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Squliq    | s**əm**əʔuŋ | səʔəŋ**un**   | 'to cut bamboo' |
| Skikun    | q**əm**ipul | qəpəl**un**   | 'to tread'      |
| S'uli     | **m**əhut   | pəhət**an**   | 'to press'      |
| Klesan    | **m**əpux   | pəx**an**     | 'to push down'  |
| Matu'uwal | t**um**aluk | talk**un**    | 'to cook'       |
| Plngawan  | k**un**luh  | kilh**un**    | 'to reap'       |
| Matu'aw   | k**um**ikuʔ | kakaʔ**un**   | 'to pinch'      |

In Squliq, Skikun, S'uli, and Klesan, the vowel /u/ alternates with /ə/ in suffixed forms.  In Matu'aw, it alternates with /a/ instead (Matu'aw completely disallows the vowel [ə], see @sec:matuaw-vowels). In Matu'uwal and Plngawan, the vowel is more commonly deleted after suffixation.

These roots with an alternating vowel contrast with roots that have non-alternating /u/ phoneme in the final syllable. Examples of such roots are given in @tbl:non-alternating-final-u.

: Non-alternating stems with /u/ in the final syllable {#tbl:non-alternating-final-u}

| Dialect   | AV form     | Suffixed form | Gloss           |

| Squliq    | **m**aqut   | pəqut**an**   | 'to ask'        |
| Skikun    | t**əm**ubux | təbux**un**   | 'to sow'        |
| S'uli     | kəsyus      | kəsyus**an**  | 'to stir-fry'   |
| Klesan    | **pə**hapuy | puy**un**     | 'to cook grain' |
| Matu'uwal | t**um**akuʔ | takuʔ**un**   | 'to scoop up'   |
| Plngawan  | t**um**abul | tabul**un**   | 'to till'       |
| Matu'aw   | s**um**yuk  | syuk**un**    | 'to answer'     |
<!-- fixme: huang2018? -->

There is a clear difference between the verbs in @tbl:root-final-schwa-alternations and the verbs in @tbl:non-alternating-final-u with regard to the vowel /u/ in the final syllable of the root. In @tbl:root-final-schwa-alternations, this vowel comes from an original \*ə, which was later changed to /u/ only in the final syllable. We can corroborate this with evidence from Proto-Austronesian reconstructions, cf. PAN \*taNək and Matu'uwal *taluk* 'to cook'. The PV suffix *-un* in Atayal itself comes from PAN \*-ən.

#### Vowel coalescence {#sec:vowel-coalescence}

This alternation phenomenon occurs in almost all Atayal dialects, with the exception of Matu'uwal. Its effect is the change of two separate vowel segments into a single vowel, and it is induced by suffixation. @egerod1965 has some Squliq data with these changes, but it is rather haphazard; Li [-@li1980, pp. 372-373] provides many examples for Squliq, divided by category; Chen [-@chen2012, pp. 116-126] talks about vowel coalescence in Plngawan. @tbl:vowel-coalescence-dialects demonstrates this phenomenon with the PV suffix *-un* and the LV suffix *-an*.

The environment for vowel coalescence is a root ending in a glottal stop,^[In the case of S'uli and Klesan, which here are analyzed as not having word-final phonemic glottal stops, the environment also includes vowel-final roots (see [@sec:suli-phonotactics;@sec:culi-phonotactics] for a discussion of S'uli and Klesan phonotactics).] and a vowel-initial suffix, such as *-un* or *-an*. If the two vowels are identical, they merge into one vowel. If the final vowel of the root is /a/ and it is followed by the suffix *-un*, then the vowels coalesce into a mid vowel /o/. The glottal stop is lost in the suffixed form, thus Squliq /kitaʔ/ + /-an/ > /kətan/.

Note that in Squliq, Skikun, S'uli, and Klesan, the penultimate vowel in the suffixed forms in @tbl:vowel-coalescence-dialects is always weakened, even though the syllable is in the rightmost foot. In synchronic phonological terms, this is an instance of **overapplication opacity**. From the point of view of diachronic phonology, we would say that prepenultimate vowel weakening in these forms applied before vowel coalescence.

I do not have any Matu'aw data for coalescence of a low and a high vowel into a mid vowel, i.e. /-aʔ/ + /-un/ > /-on/. This may be due to the paucity of data in my own field notes, or due to Matu'aw disallowing it. More data is needed to understand the limits of vowel coalescence in Matu'aw.

Plngawan has additional environments for vowel coalescence: a high vowel /i/ or /u/ in the final syllable of the root, followed by a glottal stop, and a suffix beginning with /a/, such as *-an*. These coalesce into the mid vowel /e/ or /o/, depending on the frontness of the high vowel in the root. We therefore have *cabuʔ* + *-an* > *cab**on*** 'to wrap (LV)'. This word is distinguished from *cab**un*** 'to wrap (PV)' (< *cabuʔ* + *-un*). Other dialects do not have vowel coalescence in this environment, but instead change the high vowel into a homorganic glide after deleting the glottal stop, as shown in @tbl:gliding-high-vowels-before-an.

: Gliding of high vowels before *-an* in Atayal dialects {#tbl:gliding-high-vowels-before-an}

| Dialect | Base   | Suffixed form | Gloss        |
|---------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Matu'aw | ʔaluʔ  | ʔalw**an**    | 'to close'   |
| S'uli   | ʔəluʔ  | ʔəlw**an**    | 'to close'   |
| Matu'aw | pawgiʔ | pugy**an**    | 'to sun-dry' |
| S'uli   | pawgi  | pəgy**an**    | 'to sun-dry' |
| Skikun  | pugiʔ  | pəgy**an**    | 'to sun-dry' |
| Klesan  | pogiʔ  | pəgy**an**    | 'to sun-dry' |

Neither gliding nor vowel coalescence apply in Matu'uwal, which instead preserves the root-final glottal stops, e.g. /pawgiʔ/ + /-an/ > /pugiʔ**an**/ 'to sun-dry'.^[The vowel change in the root is a different phenomenon, discussed in @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng.]

In some cases, vowel coalescence in Plngawan, S'uli, and Klesan is **underapplied**, and both vowels along with the glottal stop are preserved. The glottal stop in these words originates from a historical \*q, which can be seen in cognates in other dialects, such as Squliq. @tbl:underapplication-coalescence-historical-q shows several such examples.

: Underapplication of vowel coalescence in roots with historical \*q {#tbl:underapplication-coalescence-historical-q}

| bitaʔ**an** | bətaʔ**an** | taʔ**an**    | betaq**an**  | 'to stab (LV)'  |
| baʔ         | ba          | ba           | baq          | 'to know (AV)'  |
| baʔ**un**   | baʔ**un**   | baʔ**un**    | baq**un**    | 'to know (PV)'  |
| **m**aseʔ   |             | **m**əsya    | **m**əsyaq   | 'to laugh (AV)' |
| paseʔ**an** |             | pəsyaʔ**an** | pəsyaq**an** | 'to laugh (LV)' |

From a diachronical perspective, this means that vowel coalescence preceded the loss of \*q in these dialects. This is further discussed in @sec:proto-atayal-to-dialects.

#### Hiatus resolution in Matu'uwal {#sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution}

Matu'uwal is the only Atayal dialect that distinguishes hiatuses, or vowel clusters, from two vowels with an intervening glottal stop. However, there is a restriction on hiatuses: they may only occur in the final foot of a word. If a root with a hiatus is suffixed, the hiatus is no longer inside the final foot, and thus must be resolved.

There are two kinds of hiatuses in Matu'uwal: (1) two identical vowels, and (2) a low vowel /a/ followed by a high vowel, called *closing hiatuses* from here on. The reason I do not consider other combinations to be hiatuses is because they do not show this alternating behaviour: the phonetically audible glides between those vowels must therefore be phonemic, so that hiatus resolution does not apply in those cases.

The two kinds of hiatuses are resolved differently in Matu'uwal. If a root with an identical vowel hiatus is suffixed, the hiatus becomes a single vowel, as demonstrated in @tbl:ml-identical-hiatus-resolution.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Resolution of identical vowel hiatuses in Matu'uwal}
\label{tbl:ml-identical-hiatus-resolution}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l } \toprule
AV         & PV/LV     & Gloss              \\ \midrule \addlinespace

h\textbf{um}iiʔ & hiʔ\textbf{an} & `to pour'          \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The precise phonological nature of this change (deletion, coalescence) is up for debate. The end result in all three cases in @tbl:ml-identical-hiatus-resolution is CV.CVC structure, i.e. identical vowel hiatus resolution results in an open penultimate syllable.

Closing hiatuses are resolved differently. Instead of deletion or coalescence, the high vowel is simply glided, thus becoming a consonantal coda. This process can be seen in @tbl:ml-closing-hiatus-resolution.

: Resolution of closing hiatuses in Matu'uwal {#tbl:ml-closing-hiatus-resolution}

| AV         | PV/LV      | Gloss     |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| **m**aiq   | bayq**an** | 'to give' |
| c**um**aum | cawm**an** | 'to wipe' |
| k**um**aiʔ | kayʔ**an** | 'to dig'  |

The end result of resolving a closing hiatus is CVG.CVC structure, where the penult is a closed syllable with a glide coda.

The commonality between these two kinds of hiatus resolution is the reduction in the number of syllables and resyllabification. Thus, by adding a monosyllabic suffix to a disyllabic base, we still get a disyllabic word after hiatus resolution applies. This can be seen in @tbl:resyllab-hiatus-resolution-ml.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Resyllabification after hiatus resolution in Matu'uwal}
\label{tbl:resyllab-hiatus-resolution-ml}

/ka.iʔ/ & /kay.ʔ\textbf{an}/ & `to dig'   \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The hiatus resolution rule can also interact with rhythmic vowel reduction (discussed in @sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng), however, these interactions are quite complex and outside the scope of this study. They should be looked upon in more detail in future research.

#### Vowel reduction in Matu'uwal and Plngawan {#sec:vowel-reduction-matu-plng}

Matu'uwal, Plngawan, and Matu'aw are the only dialects that do not exhibit prepenultimate vowel reduction (discussed in @sec:prepen-vowel-weakening). However, Matu'uwal and Plngawan (and perhaps Matu'aw as well) still have vowel reduction processes operating on vowels outside the head foot, but they are not as total as in Squliq or Klesan.

These vowel reduction processes have not received very much attention from researchers. Nevertheless, Chen [-@chen2012, pp. 87-115] has explored affixation-related vowel reduction in Plngawan using an Optimality theoretic approach, and @huang2017a looks at the patterns in Matu'uwal. The patterns themselves are presented in @tbl:vowel-reduction-ml-pl, with cognates for ease of comparison.

: Vowel reduction comparison for Matu'uwal and Plngawan {#tbl:vowel-reduction-ml-pl}

| Matu'uwal         | Plngawan           | Gloss                       |

| q**in**umas**an** | ʔ**in**mas**an**   | 'pickled vegetables'        |
| g**um**hahapuy    | **pa**hpuy         | 'to cook (AV)'              |
| gəhapuy**un**     | **pa**hpuy**un**   | 'to cook (PV)'              |
| **təsi**gariŋ     | **tas**ʔariŋ       | 'to start a fire'           |
| lahulahuw         | lahlahuɹ           | 'wilderness'                |
| s**um**iyahuq     | s**un**ɹahuʔ       | 'to be late (AV)'           |
| **pə**haŋal**an** | **pa**hŋaleʔ**an** | 'to carry on shoulder (LV)' |
| s**um**irmaʔ      | s**un**ramaʔ       | 'to prepare (AV)'           |

The vowel reduction patterns are obviously quite different. For one, Matu'uwal reduces some vowels to a schwa, which does not happen in Plngawan. Secondly, reduction does not occur evenly in both dialects: some forms are reduced only in one dialect, but not the other. There are also similarities: vowel reduction can affect roots and prefixes in both dialects, though infixes remain unaffected.

The rules of vowel reduction in Matu'uwal and Plngawan operate on completely different principles. Reduction in Matu'uwal is **rhythmic**, meaning that it is conditioned metrically, and operates on the fourth-to-last vowel [@huang2017a]. The metrical quality of Matu'uwal vowel reduction can be seen in @tbl:rhythmic-vowel-weakening-ml, with prefixed/infixed data in the AV column, and suffixed data in the PV/LV column.

: Rhythmic vowel weakening in Matu'uwal {#tbl:rhythmic-vowel-weakening-ml}

| AV               | PV/LV                 | Gloss               |
|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| h**um**icuwaʔ    | həcuwal**un**         | 'how'               |
| **pa**ʔnahuway   | ʔanhuway**un**        | 'to be able'        |
| s**um**anminuqil | sanamnuqil**un**      | 'to kill'           |
| **məka**gauŋ     | **pak**gawŋ**un**     | 'to go along river' |
| **mas**kakaruʔ   | **pəsi**kakaruʔ**an** | 'to talk, to chat'  |
| **mas**tatail    | **pəsi**tatayl**an**  | 'to jump'           |

Since reduction operates on the fourth-to-last vowel and does not affect infixes, it requires a long enough stem to demonstrate. The first three rows show reduction in 3-, 4-, and 5-syllable stems. In AV forms of 3-syllable stems (e.g. *h**um**icuwaʔ*), the fourth-to-last vowel is in the infix, and so the reduction does not apply. By adding a monosyllabic suffix to the root (*həcuwal**un***, note the alternating consonant), the fourth-to-last vowel is now in the root and is reduced. However, since it is in the leftmost syllable, there is no way to resyllabify this word, and the vowel is left as a surface schwa.

In longer stems (or with longer prefixes), the weakened vowel will no longer be in the leftmost syllable, and will be therefore completely deleted, with resyllabification taking place. Here I analyze the stem of 'to be able' as *ʔanahuway*, assuming that underlyingly all the vowels are present in the stem. This stem is long enough to undergo reduction in both prefixed and suffixed forms, but the vowel that is weakened is different in the two cases. After weakening, the word is resyllabified, and the final result contains a non-final closed syllable.

The rhythmic reduction rule even applies to prefixes, as can be seen in the final three rows in @tbl:rhythmic-vowel-weakening-ml. The derivational prefixes *paka-* (AV *maka-*) and *pasi-* (AV *masi-*) are reduced diffently depending on how many syllables they are preceded by. Thus, in the form ***məka**gauŋ* /mə.ka.ga.uŋ/ 'to go along river (AV)' the first vowel of the prefix is reduced, as it is the fourth-to-last vowel of the word. If the stem is suffixed, it becomes ***pak**gawng**un*** /pak.gaw.ŋun/ 'to go along river (PV)', with the second vowel in the prefix reduced, because it was fourth-to-last in the underlying representation. Note that this root also has a hiatus, which is resolved by gliding in the suffixed form (see @sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution). The gliding must occur before vowel reduction in order to be applied properly. This is an instance of **counterbleeding opacity**, meaning that the proper environment for vowel reduction cannot be deduced from only the surface form, due to hiatus resolution applying first.^[Here I use a rule-based phonological explanation, since opacity is notoriously difficult to deal with in constraint-based approaches, such as Optimality theory.]

The final two examples, ***mas**kakaruʔ\~**pəsi**kakaruʔ**an*** 'to talk, to chat' and ***mas**tatail\~**pəsi**tatayl**an*** 'to jump' have 3-syllable stems, but the initial syllable is C*a*-reduplication on the root. Rhythmic vowel reduction does not normally apply in reduplicated forms, which is why the fourth-to-last vowel is still present in ***pəsi**kakaruʔ**an*** and ***pəsi**tatayl**an*** (another reason may be anti-gemination). Nevertheless, we see reduction of the sixth-to-last vowel in both forms, which confirms that the weakening rule indeed applies metrically in an iambic pattern, just like predicted by @huang2017a.

Unlike Matu'uwal, the vowel reduction pattern in Plngawan does not appear to be rhythmic. Chen [-@chen2012, pp. 87-115] only looks at a small subset of forms with vowel reduction in Plngawan, namely those with *-in-* infixation. Her analysis was thus very specific to this particular infix, in that the vowel after it gets deleted. In actuality, Plngawan allows vowel reduction to occur in other environments as well, some of which are shown in @tbl:plngawan-vowel-syncope.

: Vowel syncope in Plngawan {#tbl:plngawan-vowel-syncope}

| Plngawan           | Gloss                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| ʔ**in**mas**an**   | 'pickled vegetables'        |
| s**un**ɹahuʔ       | 'to be late (AV)'           |
| pahpuy             | 'to cook (AV)'              |
| pahpuy**un**       | 'to cook (PV)'              |
| **pa**hŋaleʔ**an** | 'to carry on shoulder (LV)' |
| lahlahuɹ           | 'wilderness'                |
| **mu**hlaʔiy       | 'winter'                    |
| **mas**hulaʔiy     | 'to snow'                   |
| **mas**taɹil       | 'to jump (AV)'              |
| **pas**taɹil**an** | 'to jump (PV)'              |

The major difference between Plngawan vowel syncope and Matu'uwal vowel weakening is that the former does not depend on metricality, or at least not right-to-left metricality. The metrical structure of a stem does not change after adding a suffix: compare Plngawan ***mas**taɹil\~**pas**taɹil**an*** and Matu'uwal ***mas**tatail\~**pəsi**tatayl**an*** 'to jump'.

Instead, it is always the leftmost syllable in Plngawan that becomes closed after vowel syncope is applied, no matter how many syllables are to its right. This contrast is demonstrated with the pair ***mu**hlaʔiy* /muh.la.ʔiː/ 'winter' and ***mas**hulaʔiy* /mas.hu.la.ʔiː/ 'to snow', both of which are derived from *hulaʔiy* 'snow'. It is thus always the second vowel from the left edge that gets deleted where this rule applies. However, since unlike Matu'uwal vowel weakening, Plngawan vowel syncope does not lead to alternations with disyllabic prefixes, it could be argued that, synchronically speaking, the rule does not apply in cases like ***mas**hulaʔiy* at all, and that *mas-*/*pas-* is simply the underlying form of the prefix. Nevertheless, there is still a common pattern with roots that do alternate, like ***mu**hlaʔiy* 'winter' (< *hulaʔiy* 'snow') or ***pa**hŋaleʔ**an*** 'to carry on shoulder (LV)' (< *haŋaliʔ* 'shoulder').

There are also disyllabic prefixes in Plngawan where syncope does not apply, for example, ***maku**ramas* 'to get better, to make up (after an argument)' (< *ramas* 'good'), ***maku**ɹakeh* 'to become enemies' (< *ɹakeh* 'bad'), ***maku**ʔaraʔ* 'to wear trousers' (< *ʔaraʔ* 'trousers'). But cf. ***mak**sapit* 'to wear shoes' (< *sapit* 'shoes') and ***mak**tamukuʔ* 'to wear a hat' (< *tamukuʔ* 'hat'), where the prefix is *mak-* instead of *maku-*.

Plngawan vowel syncope is still poorly understood, and requires further research. A closer look at vowel weakening in Matu'uwal would also be helpful, especially its interactions with other vowel reduction processes, such as hiatus resolution. So far we only have the picture in very broad strokes, and many of the finer details remain to be uncovered.

## Interim summary

In this chapter I looked at the phonological systems of seven different Atayal dialects, and explored their consonant and vowel inventories, syllable structure, phonotactics, as well as synchronic alternations.

In the past, such studies have mostly been limited to just one dialect. Even @li1980 wrote mostly about alternations in Squliq, though he did include some limited information on other dialects as well.

This chapter is a state-of-the-art look at the comparative phonology of Atayal. I have tried to devote equal space to all dialects, though some unfortunately remain understudied. I have also included the results of studies done on Atayal since @li1980, especially those that deal with its synchronic phonology.

I hope this chapter adequately shows the diversity of Atayal dialects in various areas of phonology. Vowel systems can range from as few as three vowels to as many as six, there may or may not be restrictions on closed syllables, vowels outside the head foot, and certain consonants in word-final position.

Consonant inventories are quite similar between Atayal dialects. The main differences reside in the presence or absence of \<c\> /t͡s/ and /q/ as separate phonemes. Plngawan is the only Atayal dialect to have /ɹ/ as a distinct phoneme.

The phonotactics of consonants vary more than the inventories themselves. The only dialect that allows voiced obstruents /b/ and /g/ to occur word-finally is Matu'uwal (although Matu'aw speakers still preserved final /g/ when Li was doing his fieldwork there around 1980). Matu'uwal and Matu'aw are the only two dialects where /x/ can occur word-initially, and only in one or two words (unless we count word-initial devoiced /g/ in Skikun as /x/). Plngawan and Klesan disallow labials in word-final position, merging them with velars. The glottal stop appears to have largely lost its functional load in word-final position in both S'uli and Klesan, thus it is not marked in this dissertation; other dialects still distinguish final glottal stops from final open syllables quite clearly.

Most Atayal dialects have mid vowels /e/ and /o/: Matu'uwal and Matu'aw are the exceptions. In other dialects, mid vowels are commonly the result of coalescence of two vowels or a diphthong, or sometimes vowel assimilation or lowering effects of nearby consonants. Schwa appears in most dialects, with only Plngawan and Matu'aw lacking it, though it can never be stressed.

Syllable structure shows some minor differences. Matu'uwal is the only dialect that allows onsetless syllables (but only in final position, thus forming a hiatus in the final foot). Closed syllables are allowed word-finally in all dialects, but are much more limited in non-final position: Matu'uwal and Plngawan allow them everywhere, whereas in other dialects they are mostly restricted to morpheme boundaries [there is significant variation in Squliq, see @huang2015].

There are some commonalities in synchronic alternations, and they include both inherited irregularities as well as those developed separately due to drift (and perhaps language contact). There are also tendencies to regularize some of these irregularities, and these can be more prominent in some dialects than in others. There is still enough irregularity spread across different dialects to be able to trace it back to their origin, Proto-Atayal.

The most commonly found alternation is probably \<c\> /t͡s/ to /t/, with \<c\> /t͡s/ surfacing before suffixes, as in Matu'uwal *k\<um\>at\~kac-un* 'to bite'. Other alternations, such as ∅ to /s/, or /ʔ/ to /l/, are found in only a very small number of words. These have mostly been well-preserved across the Atayal dialects, the former only being regularized in Skikun, and the latter in Squliq.

Regularization processes in verbal paradigms should not be overlooked when conducting historical linguistic research. They may give the appearance of inherited regularity, or else a special environment, where there is none. The impact of regularization on historical reconstructions is discussed in @sec:paradigm-leveling.

# Proto-Atayal phonology {#sec:proto-atayal-phonology}

In this chapter, I use the Comparative Method to reconstruct the phonological system of Proto-Atayal. @sec:sound-correspondences presents the sound correspondences between Atayal dialects in order to reconstruct the individual phonemes of Proto-Atayal. The full phoneme inventory of Proto-Atayal is presented in @sec:proto-atayal-phoneme-inventory. The syllable structure and phonotactic restrictions of Proto-Atayal are listed in @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics. I also examine external evidence for reconstructions in @sec:external-evidence-phono, both from closely related Seediq and from reconstructed Proto-Austronesian words. The sound changes from Proto-Atayal to each individual dialect are presented in @sec:proto-atayal-to-dialects, the sound changes from Proto-Atayalic to Proto-Atayal can be found in @sec:proto-atayalic-to-proto-atayal, and @sec:pan-to-proto-atayal examines the sound correspondences between Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Atayal. The sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Atayal dialects are presented in table form in @sec:phono-summary.

## Sound correspondences {#sec:sound-correspondences}

This section presents the sound correspondences of individual phonemes, used to reconstruct phonemes and lexical items in Proto-Atayal. It is further subdivided into sections on consonant correspondences (@sec:consonant-correspondences), vowel correspondences in the final two syllables (@sec:vowel-correspondences), vowel correspondences in the third-to-last syllable and beyond (@sec:prepenult-vowel-correspondences).

### Consonant correspondences {#sec:consonant-correspondences}

Each consonant protophoneme is reconstructed based on correspondences in several environments: word-initial, word-medial, and word-final (where applicable). For those protophonemes which have additional reflexes in more specific environments, those environtments are included as well.

The correspondence of Proto-Atayal \*p is generally regular, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-p. Word-initial and word-medial reflexes are /p/ in all dialects. Word-finally, \*p is reflected as /p/ in all dialects except Plngawan and Klesan, where it is /k/ in this position instead.

The reason for the velar reflex in Plngawan and Klesan is a process by which final labials merge with velars in these two dialects. This process is detailed in @sec:merger-labial-velar. Note that in both Plngawan and Klesan the historical \*p surfaces when the verb is suffixed: *yup**an*** 'to blow (LV)'.

Proto-Atayal \*t is mostly reflected as /t/, though in certain positions it may become an affricate, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-t.

In Squliq, Proto-Atayal \*t is always reflected as an affricate before /i/ or its corresponding glide \<y\> /j/. Skikun does occasionally allow the sequence /ti/, although it is very rare (see @sec:skikun-phonotactics). In Klesan and S'uli, words with and without affrication can be found. Sometimes even the same word may exhibit two variants, e.g.: *timu* or *cimu* 'salt', *tikay* or *cikay* 'a little, a bit', *hyuti* or *hyuci* 'slippery'. There is variation from village to village and speaker to speaker, and sometimes even within a single speaker's speech. The most likely source of this dichotomy is Squliq, see @sec:interdialectal-borrowings for further discussion.

In word-final position, /t/ may also be pronounced as a dental affricate [t͡s] by some speakers, as mentioned in @sec:merger-final-c-t. This is dependent on individual speakers: I personally have witnessed both the presence and absence of this pronunciation from different speakers of Squliq, Skikun, Plngawan, and S'uli. This is simply a variant pronunciation of /t/ word-finally, and not a different phoneme, so it is not taken into consideration here.

The correspondences of Proto-Atayal \*k, shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-k, are mostly /k/ in all dialects. In some environments, it was backed into /q/ in Squliq, Skikun, and Matu'uwal.

This assimilation process was noted in Li [-@li1980, p. 377] for Squliq and Skikun. The environment for this change is a following /h/ or /q/ in the root [@li1981, p. 248]. A similar assimilation also took place in the closely related Seediq language [@lee2009]. Occasionally, Squliq or Skikun also back Proto-Atayal \*k into /q/ sporadically, see @sec:shared-innovations-sq-sk for more information.

In Matu'uwal, *k*-backing can only be found in three roots in my dataset: /quriq/ 'to steal', /qaniq/ 'to eat', and /qəbaq/ 'to know'. All three are disyllabic and end with /q/ (the initial /q/ comes from historical \*k). However, the initial /q/ does not surface in the roots /qaniq/ 'to eat' and /qəbaq/ 'to know' in the indicative mood: ***m**aniq* 'to eat (AV)', *niq**un*** 'to eat (PV)', *baq* 'to know (AV)', *baq**un*** 'to know (PV)', cf. subjunctive mood forms *qaniq* 'to eat (AV.SBJV)', *qəbaq* 'to know (AV.SBJV)'. Note that even though /qumuriq/ has three syllables, the root is /quriq/, which is disyllabic, with *-um-* being the Actor Voice infix. In contrast /kahuniq/ has three syllables in the root and retains initial /k/. The environment for \*k > q in Matu'uwal is thus /kVCVq/, but it is morphologically sensitive and applies to the root as a whole, including infixed forms.

Proto-Atayal \*q is reflected as /q/ in Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun, and as /ʔ/ in other dialects. The correspondences can be seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-q.

As stated in @sec:suli-phonotactics and @sec:culi-phonotactics, I analyze S'uli and Klesan as having no phonemic glottal stops in word-final position. This applies to words with historical word-final \*q as well.

Note that vowel coalescence in the final foot does not apply in roots with historical \*q, as mentioned in @sec:vowel-coalescence. Unlike roots with historical \*ʔ, here the glottal stop is preserved, as seen in Plngawan *c**um**aʔis*, Klesan *c**əm**aʔes*, Matu'aw *s**um**aʔis* 'to sew'. If an intervocalic \*q precedes the final syllable, its reflex is /ʔ/ in S'uli and Matu'aw, but ∅ in Plngawan and Klesan: S'uli and Matu'aw *waʔanux*, Plngawan and Klesan *wanux* 'sambar deer'.

The glottal stop is preserved in initial position in all dialects, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-glot. Word-finally, Klesan and S'uli appear to have lost the distinction between final /ʔ/ and final open syllables, and therefore I do not consider them to have final glottal stops.

Word-medial glottal stops in Proto-Atayal appear to have been rare outside suffixed forms, and here Matu'uwal is the only dialect that reliably preserves them. The exception here are word-medial glottal stops preceded by a schwa, as in 'to feed' in @tbl:proto-atayal-glot. In other cases, word-medial glottal stops surrounded by full vowels were deleted in all dialects except Matu'uwal. The vowels on either side of Proto-Atayal \*ʔ were coalesced into a GV sequence or a single vowel: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > Matu'uwal *riʔax*, Skikun *ryax*, Plngawan *rex*. This process is identical to suffixation-induced vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of these dialects, described in @sec:vowel-coalescence.

Proto-Atayal \*b is reflected as /b/ in word-initial and word-medial positions in all dialects, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-b. Note that the phoneme /b/ may phonetically be a bilabial plosive [b], a bilabial fricative [β], or a labiodental fricative [v]. These different phonetic realizations are treated as identical on the phonemic level.

Word-final \*b is only preserved as /b/ in Matu'uwal. In all other dialects it is devoiced, and in Plngawan and Klesan its place of articulation becomes velar instead of labial in addition to devoicing.

| Squliq       | baŋaʔ    | ʔabaw    | pəhəgup   | q**əm**atap          |

Word-final \*b may be reconstructed based on Matu'uwal evidence, or based on consonant alternations in verbal roots. For example, the verb *q**əm**atap* 'to cut with scissors' in Squliq becomes *qətab**an*** when suffixed, revealing the underlying /b/ phoneme. However, this process is not infallible: the Plngawan cognate *ʔ**um**atak* becomes *ʔatap**an*** after suffixation, still preserving the labial feature of the final root consonant, but losing the voicing.

Proto-Atayal \*g is regularly reflected as /g/ in all dialects in word-initial and word-medial positions, with the exception of Skikun, where initial /g/ tends to be devoiced into /x/ in an ongoing merger of these two phonemes (see @sec:skikun-consonants). Word-finally it is lenited in most dialects except Matu'uwal and Skikun, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-g.

Word-final \*g is preserved as /g/ in Matu'uwal and as /x/ in Skikun when preceded by /a/ or /u/. According to Li's [-@li1980;-@li1981] data, Matu'aw^[Called "Matabalay" in Li's publications.] still preserved final /g/ even following an /i/ when he was conducting his fieldwork on the dialect around 1980. Even during that time, only speakers above the age of 60 still preserved it, whereas "younger" speakers (around 50 years old at the time) no longer had it in word-final position [@li1980, p. 385]. Naturally, it had been completely lost by the time I conducted my fieldwork on Matu'aw in early 2020. Li's data can be used to reconstruct final \*g in several lexical items. Likewise, Seediq cognates can also be used to identify words with historical final \*-ig, see @sec:evidence-from-seediq-phono for more details.

In other dialects, word-final \*g is reflected as a glide after the low vowel /a/, as seen in reflexes of \*ʔabag 'leaves' in the table. After high vowels (including Matu'uwal and Skikun for reflexes of \*-ig), it manifests itself as vowel length, e.g. Proto-Atayal \*ŋuhug 'nose' > Squliq *ŋuhuw* [ŋu.ˈħuː], Proto-Atayal \*wahig 'vine' > Squliq *wahiy* [wa.ˈħiː]. Long vowels in the final syllable are traditionally written with a homorganic glide following the long vowel, both by linguists and Atayal speakers (only Matu'uwal has long low vowel /a/, which is normally left unmarked).

Verbs with Proto-Atayal final \*-ig have an alternating /s/ that appears in suffixed forms, for example Matu'uwal *r**um**ahiy\~rahis**an*** 'to dry in the air'. There are only a few of such verbs; see also discussion in @sec:other-consonant-alternations.

However, not all lexical items with final *-iy* in modern dialects had a \*g coda in Proto-Atayal. Several examples are discussed in @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics.

Proto-Atayal \*c is reflected as \<c\> /t͡s/ in all dialects except Squliq, S'uli, and Matu'aw, where it merges with \*s, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-c.

| Squliq       | s**əm**aqis   | s**əm**yuk     | bəsiluŋ      |

The phoneme \<c\> /t͡s/ does not appear in word-final position in any Atayal dialect, but it does alternate with /t/ in verbal roots, as explained in @sec:merger-final-c-t. This alternation can be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal, and there is no evidence that Proto-Atayal \*c appeared word-finally. See @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics for more details.

Proto-Atayal \*s is reflected as /s/ everywhere except one very specific environment in Plngawan and Squliq, where it undergoes rhotacism. The correspondences are shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-s.

| Squliq       | sənyuw    | pəsaniq   | ʔirah           | **m**usaʔ   |

The environment for rhotacism in Plngawan and Squliq is identical: \*s became /r/ when preceded by the vowel /i/ and followed by a stressed vowel (i.e. final vowel). Thus, Proto-Atayal words like \*ʔisah 'sister-in-law'^[English does not have a specific enough translation for this word. It refers to the wife of one's older brother, but I translate it as 'sister-in-law' in the text and the table for brevity.], \*pisaʔ 'how many', \*kisaʔ 'today, soon' become *ʔirah*, *piraʔ*, and *kiraʔ*, respectively, in both Plngawan and Squliq. If the vowel preceding \*s is anything other than \*i, rhotacism does not occur, e.g. Proto-Atayal \***m**usaʔ 'to go (AV)' > Plngawan, Squliq ***m**usaʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*taɹasi 'straw hat' > Plngawan *taɹasiʔ*, Squliq *cyasiʔ*. Neither does it happen if the vowel following \*s is not the stressed (final) vowel: Proto-Atayal \*pisaniq 'taboo' > Plngawan *pisaniʔ*, Squliq *pəsaniq*.
<!-- TODO: draw pretty rule scheme -->

The rhotacism rule is also subject to paradigm leveling (see @sec:paradigm-leveling). Verbs with roots ending in /-is/ do not undergo rhotacism, e.g. Plngawan ***m**aŋilis\~caŋis**an*** and Squliq ***m**əŋilis\~ləŋis**an*** 'to cry' (note the metathesis between the AV and LV forms). On the other hand, verbs with the ∅\~s alternation have an alternating /r/ in Plngawan and Squliq instead: Squliq ***mə**baziy\~bəzir**un*** 'to buy', Plngawan ***m**agiy\~pager**an*** 'to run away'. See @sec:other-consonant-alternations for more examples of these alternations.

Proto-Atayal \*x is regularly reflected as /x/ in all dialects, except in reflexes of the word \*xuɹil 'dog', as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-x.

| Squliq       | huzil   | saxaʔ          | ŋarux   |

There is only a single protoform where I reconstruct initial \*x in Proto-Atayal, and that is \*xuɹil 'dog'. Most dialects do not allow /x/ to appear word-initially at all, and those that do only have one or two words with initial /x/. Skikun is an exception due to its merger of Proto-Atayal \*x and \*g. Also because of this merger, intervocalic \*x may sometimes be reflected as a voiced fricative /g/ instead. See @sec:skikun-consonants for details.

The word-final reflex of Proto-Atayal \*m in Plngawan and Klesan is /ŋ/. This is exactly the same process that affects word-final \*b and \*p, and is further discussed in @sec:merger-labial-velar.

Proto-Atayal \*n is generally reflected as /n/ in all positions, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-n.

Some speakers may pronounce this phoneme as a velar nasal [ŋ] word-finally, and my transcription of Klesan 'door' as *bəlihuŋ* reflects this. However, this velar pronunciation is not always consistent, and varies from speaker to speaker. This may indicate the beginnings of a merger between /n/ and /ŋ/ in word-final position.

The regular reflex of Proto-Atayal \*ŋ is /ŋ/ in all positions across all dialects, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-ng.

The reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*l are /l/ in word-initial and word-medial position in all dialects, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-l. There is some slight variation in word-final reflexes.

Word-final \*l may be reflected as /n/ in the speech of some speakers. This is common in the speech of younger speakers across the spectrum of Atayal dialects, however in my fieldwork on S'uli and Klesan, this sound change was present even with older speakers, and appears to be complete there. There is much individual variation with how final \*l is reflected, with /n/ being a more 'innovative' pronunciation that transcends dialect boundaries. See @sec:merger-final-l-n for more information on this sound change.

The reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*r are generally /r/ in word-initial and word-medial positions, except in cases of liquid assimilation. Word-final reflexes of \*r are less systematic. Some examples are given in @tbl:proto-atayal-r.

: Correspondences of Proto-Atayal \*r {#tbl:proto-atayal-r}

| Squliq       | laluʔ   | ryax    | paraʔ     | h**əm**or     | tamul   |

Liquid assimilation happens in Squliq, Skikun, S'uli, and Klesan. If an onset \*r was followed by an \*l in the onset of another syllable, the \*r changed to /l/. Thus, Proto-Atayal \*raluʔ 'name' > Squliq, Skikun *laluʔ*.
<!-- TODO: sound change scheme -->

This liquid assimilation was not triggered if \*l was in a syllable coda, whether in the same syllable as \*r or a different one: e.g. (PAn \*dapaN >) Proto-Atayal \*rapal 'sole (of foot)' > Squliq, Skikun *rapal*, or Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Squliq, Skikun *kəneril*.

Reflexes of Proto-Atayal word-final \*r are not very systematic across dialects. It may be reflected as /r/ or as /l/ (and in S'uli and Klesan as /n/ due to the \*l > /n/ sound change word-finally). For example, in @tbl:proto-atayal-r, the reflexes of \*r in Proto-Atayal \*h**um**aur 'to flood' are /r/ in Matu'uwal, Skikun, Klesan, and Squliq; but neither Klesan nor Squliq preserve the final \*r in Proto-Atayal \*tamur 'yeast' (reconstructed based on the Matu'uwal reflex *tamur*). Apparently Matu'uwal did not preserve final \*r in all cases either: for example in Proto-Atayal \*kaʔur 'Taiwan beauty snake' (錦蛇) > Matu'uwal *kaul*, but Squliq, Skikun, Klesan *kor*.

All in all, the inconsistency of the reflexes of final \*r makes it difficult to reconstruct with certainty. For verbal roots, suffixed forms may be used, e.g. the Patient Voice form of 'to flood': Proto-Atayal \*hawr**un** 'to flood (PV)' > Matu'uwal, Matu'aw *hawr**un***, Skikun, Klesan *hor**un***. Here all dialects reflect Proto-Atayal \*r, including Matu'aw, which has a final /l/ in the AV form *h**um**awl*. However, this strategy may not always work due to paradigm leveling: see the example with reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*q**um**ur 'to seize', shown in @tbl:paradigm-leveling-qumur.

: Paradigm leveling in Proto-Atayal \*q**um**ur 'to seize, to occupy' {#tbl:paradigm-leveling-qumur}

| Proto-Atayal                  | Matu'uwal | Plngawan  | Squliq      | Skikun    |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| \text{*}q**um**ur             | q**um**ur | ʔ**um**ul | q**əm**ul   | q**əm**or |
| \text{*}qur**un**/\*qur**an** |           | ʔul**an** | pəqul**an** | qor**un** |

In both Squliq and Plngawan, even suffixed reflexes have an /l/ in the root, even though \*r should not generally be neutralized in this environment: Proto-Atayal \*qur**an** 'to seize (LV)' > Plngawan *ʔul**an***, Squliq *pəqul**an*** 'to take from each other (LV)'. Here the neutralization must have originally happened in reflexes of the Actor Voice form, where \*r was final, and then spread to suffixed forms due to paradigm leveling. We can reconstruct Proto-Atayal \*r here based on reflexes in Matu'uwal and Skikun. For more on paradigm leveling in Atayal, see @sec:paradigm-leveling.

Proto-Atayal had a second rhotic, \*ɹ, which has only been preserved in Plngawan. All other dialects have merged it with other segments or deleted it. The reason for reconstructing this cross-linguistically rare sound is addressed in @sec:proto-atayal-phoneme-inventory. Plngawan preserves \*ɹ as a retroflex approximant /ɹ/ with no changes, while all other dialects except Matu'uwal merge it with \<y\> /j/, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-approx-r. The Matu'uwal correspondences are a little more complicated.

The regular reflex of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ in Matu'uwal is ∅. Word-finally, its deletion triggered compensatory lengthening in the preceding vowel, thus Proto-Atayal \*lihuɹ 'forehead' > Matu'uwal *lihuw* [li.ˈħuː]. The /w/ here is just a spelling convention to indicate a final long [uː] vowel, and not a phonemic glide. This lengthening effect can be seen in the low vowel /a/ as well: Proto-Atayal \*takaɹ 'frog' > Matu'uwal *taka* [ta.ˈkaː]. No words with final \*-iɹ are found in my dataset, but it is hard to tell whether this is due to insufficient data, an accidental gap, or a phonotactic restriction.

Between vowels, \*ɹ was always deleted in Matu'uwal. This is the source of all identical vowel hiatuses in the language (/a.a/, /i.i/, and /u.u/), for example Proto-Atayal \*kaɹal 'sky' > Matu'uwal *kaal* [ka.ˈal], Proto-Atayal \*ʔuɹuk 'pup (animal offspring)' > Matu'uwal *ʔuuk* [ʔu.ˈuk]. A glide can be found in some words with historical \*ɹ, e.g. Proto-Atayal \*xuɹil 'dog' > Matu'uwal *xuwil*, or Proto-Atayal \***ma**huɹiq 'wet' > Matu'uwal ***ma**huwiq*, however **this is not a case of \*r > w in Matu'uwal**. A different glide surfaces when \*ɹ was preceded by \*i, as in Proto-Atayal \*s**um**iɹahuq 'to be late' > Matu'uwal *s**um**iyahuq* (cf. Plngawan *s**un**ɹahuʔ*). The glides were inserted later, after the deletion of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ, and were conditioned by the preceding vowel.

Words that began with \*ɹ in Proto-Atayal tend to have an initial glottal stop in Matu'uwal: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Matu'uwal *ʔuŋay*, Proto-Atayal \*ɹimagal 'five' > Matu'uwal *ʔimagal* (cf. PAn \*lima). The initial glottal stop was likely added to these words after the deletion of \*ɹ in order to prevent vowel-initial words, rather than a direct change of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ > *ʔ*. Words with a low vowel following an initial \*ɹ have two variant forms, based on two subdialects of Matu'uwal: Tabilas and Sahiyang [@li1981, p. 264]. Thus, Proto-Atayal \*ɹapit 'flying squirrel' > Matu'uwal *ʔapit* or *wapit*. Almost all (though not completely all) reflexes of words with initial \*ɹa- in Proto-Atayal still have these variant pronunciations.

In short, Proto-Atayal \*ɹ was deleted in Matu'uwal, except in word-initial position before \*a in one subdialect. Additional repair strategies were triggered by its deletion in some environments. Its deletion in word-final position triggered compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel.

There is another very specific environment where Proto-Atayal \*ɹ was not simply deleted, and that is \*-wr- clusters. Such clusters could only be allowed where there was an \*aw sequence in one syllable, followed by an \*ɹ onset in the following syllable. Only a few cases can be found in my data, shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-wr.

| Skikun       | royiq    | g**əm**oyax    |              |
| Plngawan     | roɹiʔ    | g**um**oɹow    | **m**oɹit    |

| Squliq       | roziq    |                | **m**uzit    |

Here all other dialects have their regular correspondences, with the usual caveats: in both S'uli and Squliq, /aw/ may be coalesced into /o/ or not, depending on the speaker. Matu'uwal has a geminate /w/ in all three words (although final /k/ in ***m**awwik* 'to drill' is irregular). Unlike words with initial \*ɹa- in Proto-Atayal, there is no subdialect distinction here. It should thus be treated as a separate change of \*ɹ > w /w\_. It is unclear if a similar gemination process would happen after the glide \*y, as I have not been able to find cognates with such a sequence. Matu'uwal *ʔayyuŋ* 'soup' may be a possible candidate (and the only word in Matu'uwal with geminate \<y\> /j/ that I have found), but there is insufficient evidence from other dialects to make an accurate reconstruction.

Proto-Atayal \*w is reflected as /w/ in most positions. In trisyllabic words, \*w was fortitioned into a fricative in several dialects, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-w. The data is scarce, and it is difficult to accurately identify the specific environment where it occurred for each dialect.

| Squliq       | gəryuŋ    | wakil     | bəqanux       | goʔ      |

In Squliq and Skikun, fortition occurs reliably in trisyllabic words, i.e. when the vowel following \*w is lenited into a schwa: Proto-Atayal \*waqanux 'sambar deer' > Squliq, Skikun *bəqanux*, Proto-Atayal \*waciluŋ 'pond, lake' > Squliq *bəsiluŋ*, Skikun *bəciluŋ*. However while in the preceding two examples \*w fortitioned into /b/, in other words it became /g/, for example Proto-Atayal \*wariyuŋ 'neck' > Squliq, Skikun *gəryuŋ*. More recently, some Squliq subdialects have also begun to fortition /w/ in other positions, for example Proto-Atayal \*wauʔ 'pigeon' > Squliq *goʔ*, or Proto-Atayal \*wagiʔ 'Sun' > Squliq *gwagiʔ* (variant of *wagiʔ*).

Other dialects have fortition happen more sporadically: Proto-Atayal \*wariyuŋ 'neck' > Klesan *gəryuŋ*, S'uli *rəgyuŋ* (with metathesis), but neither dialect has fortition in reflexes of \*waqanux 'sambar deer'. Plngawan has *giluŋ* 'chicken' < Proto-Atayal \*wayluŋ, but no other instances of \*w-fortition.

Other occurrences of \*w, such as in the 'diphthong' \*aw or in the sequence \*-uwa-, are discussed separately in @sec:vowel-correspondences, as they tend to change as a single unit.

Proto-Atayal \*y is reflected as \<y\> /j/ in all dialects, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-y. Squliq and S'uli fortition this phoneme in some environments, but it is phonologically conditioned, and thus not a true split.

In both Matu'uwal and Plngawan, penultimate \*ə was deleted in trisyllabic words: Proto-Atayal \*qalətiŋ '(wooden) plank' > Matu'uwal *qaltiŋ*, Plngawan *ʔaltiŋ*, or Proto-Atayal \*c**um**əxuʔ 'to pound grains (AV)' > Matu'uwal *c**um**xuʔ*, Plngawan *c**uŋ**xuʔ* (with nasal assimilation). In disyllabic words, Matu'uwal preserved the vowel as /ə/, but Plngawan changed it into a full vowel: either a copy of the final vowel, or /a/. For example, Proto-Atayal \*bəhut 'squirrel' > Matu'uwal *bəhut*, Plngawan *buhut* (vowel copying), but Proto-Atayal \*bəliŋ 'crack, gap' > Matu'uwal *bəliŋ*, Plngawan *baliŋ*. The choice of repair strategy is opaque when the final vowel is /a/, and can only be determined when the final vowel is high. Regrettably, there are very few items in Proto-Atayal that satisfy all the necessary conditions (disyllabic, penultimate \*ə, final high vowel) and also have a reflex in Plngawan. Apart from the items in @tbl:proto-atayal-schwa, there are only two such words in my dataset: Proto-Atayal \*kəhuʔ 'granary' > Plngawan *kuhuʔ*, and Proto-Atayal \*ɹəɹik 'deep' > Plngawan *ɹaɹik*. More data is required to determine the regular correspondence correctly.

Additionally, if penultimate \*ə was followed by \*ɹ, a different sound change took place in Matu'uwal. Since the regular correspondence of \*ɹ in this dialect is ∅, the application of this sound change put \*ə directly before the final vowel, where it fully assimilated, producing a hiatus with two identical vowels: Proto-Atayal \*həɹiŋ 'honey' > Matu'uwal *hiiŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*matəɹuʔ 'six' > Matu'uwal *mamatuuʔ*.

The sequence \*ay in Proto-Atayal monophthongized into /e/ in many dialects when occurring in the penultimate syllable. In @tbl:proto-atayal-ay, all dialects except for Matu'uwal and Matu'aw have this change, although some conservative speakers of other dialects, such as Squliq or S'uli, may still preserve \<ay\> /aj/ in penultimate syllables. In the final syllable, Proto-Atayal \*ay is regularly reflected as \<ay\> /aj/ except in Plngawan, where the reflex is \<iy\> [iː].

| Squliq       | kəneril    | behuy   | yuŋay    | wayay   |

In Matu'uwal, Proto-Atayal final \*ay became \<iy\> [iː] when it was directly preceded by /a/ without an intervening consonant: \*-aay > *-aiy*. The only way this environment could arise was through the deletion of \*ɹ. Thus Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Matu'uwal *ʔuŋay*, but Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > Matu'uwal *waiy*. This also applied in words where a penultimate \*ə assimilated to /a/ after the deletion of \*ɹ: Proto-Atayal \***ma**kəɹay 'dry' > Matu'uwal ***ma**kaiy*, cf. Plngawan ***ma**kɹiy*, Squliq ***mə**kəzyay*.

In parallel with \*ay, Proto-Atayal \*aw was monophthongized into /o/ in penultimate position in most dialects, except Matu'uwal and Matu'aw, though more conservative speakers of other dialects may also preserve the diphthong pronunciation. In final position, its regular reflex is /aw/ in all dialects, with the possible exception of Plngawan, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-aw.

Plngawan has /uː/ for Proto-Atayal \*-aw in two words in my dataset: Proto-Atayal \*ləhəbaw 'light (weight)' > Plngawan *lahbuw*, and Proto-Atayal \***mV**həŋaw 'to rest' > Plngawan ***ma**hŋuw*. Proto-Atayal \*-huɹaw 'to walk downhill' > Plngawan *puhuɹaw*, and Proto-Atayal \*h**um**ilaw 'to cover (with blanket)' > Plngawan *h**um**ilaw*. The regular correspondence is difficult to determine from such a small set. Additionally, the Plngawan word *ʔaguw* 'wine, alcohol' may be a regular reflex of Proto-Atayal \*quwaw, with fortition of the medial glide (see below for reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*-uwa-), which would make it the third Plngawan word to reflect \*-aw as *-uw* in my dataset.

The following three correspondences are of the Proto-Atayal sequences \*-uwa-, \*-iya-, and \*-iyu-. These sequences were disyllabic in Proto-Atayal, but changed as a single unit in some dialects. The evidence that they were indeed disyllabic comes from Matu'uwal, which retains them as disyllabic, and from sound changes. One example of such sound changes is vowel weakening in dialects like Squliq and S'uli: these sequences all behaved as two syllables with regard to the application of vowel weakening. Since there is no evidence for a light/heavy syllable distinction in Atayal, and since vowel weakening operated based on the syllable count, they must have been disyllabic. Moreover, changes of \*-uwa- and \*-iya- before \*q in Plngawan also preserve disyllabicity. The glides between two vowels may have been phonemic or strictly phonetic, but they must have been present, based on the reflexes in modern dialects. Here, I choose to write them out.

The sequence \*-uwa- in Proto-Atayal became monosyllabic in most dialects, with the exception of Matu'uwal and possibly S'uli. Other than that, it only underwent additional changes in Plngawan. The correspondences are given in @tbl:proto-atayal-uwa.

[mouth: Note that the word-initial \*ŋ in Proto-Atayal \*ŋaquwaq 'mouth' is sporadically changed to /n/ in Squliq, Skikun, and Klesan. This change is irregular and does not affect any other words. It may have originated in Nuclear Northern Atayal (ancestor of Squliq and Skikun) and spread to Klesan due to Squliq influence. See @sec:borrowings-cu for Squliq influence on Klesan and @sec:nuclear-northern-atayal-evidence for evidence for a Nuclear Northern Atayal subgroup.]

In Plngawan, \*-uwa- regularly coalesced into /o/ in most cases, both when word-final and when followed by another syllable: Proto-Atayal \*buwax 'unhusked rice' > Plngawan *box*, Proto-Atayal \*suwagiʔ 'sister-in-law' > Plngawan *sogiʔ*. However, when it was immediately preceded by \*q, it changed into /awa/ instead, for example Proto-Atayal \*quwalax 'rain' > Plngawan *ʔawalax*, but compare \*q**um**uwalax 'to rain' (with the Actor Voice infix \<um\>) > Plngawan *ʔ**um**olax*, with vowel coalescence instead. The addition of an infix split \*q away from the sequence \*-uwa-, and the regular coalescence to /o/ took place instead. The same alternation can also be seen in Proto-Atayal \*q**um**uwax 'to wash dishes (AV)' > Plngawan *ʔ**um**ox*, but Proto-Atayal \*quwax**an** 'to wash dishes (LV)' > Plngawan *ʔawax**an***.

Proto-Atayal \*-iya- developed in a parallel way with \*-uwa-: it coalesced into a single syllable in most dialects, with Matu'uwal being the exception, and it regularly monophthongized into /e/ in Plngawan, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-iya.

| Squliq       | qəsyaʔ    | syam    | qəlyan    | syaw    |

Plngawan changed \*-iya- to /e/ both on the right edge, and when followed by other syllables: Proto-Atayal \*qusiyaʔ 'water' > Plngawan *ʔuseʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*pagiyas**an** 'to run away (LV)' > Plngawan *pager**an***. It may have had a different change following \*q, just like the case with \*-uwa-, seen in Proto-Atayal \***ma**qiyanux 'alive' > Plngawan ***ma**yanux*. There is only one item in my dataset where \*q immediately precedes \*-iya-, and there is additional vowel coalescence in Plngawan ***ma**yanux*. Based on the change of \*-uwa- to /awa/ before \*q, we would expect \*-iya- to change to \<aya\> /aja/, which is indeed the case here.

Coalescence of Proto-Atayal \*-iya- to /e/ is blocked in several Plngawan forms. One of these is *syaw* 'rim, edge, shore' (< Proto-Atayal \*siyag), instead of the expected \*\**sew*. Most likely, the sound change was underapplied to avoid the infelicitous sequence /ew/, which does not appear in Plngawan. It was also not applied in the 3SG pronoun *hiyaʔ*.
<!-- but it is often the case cross-linguistically that pronouns are not subject to the same sound changes as the rest of the lexicon. -->
<!-- couldn't find citation for this last claim -->

Proto-Atayal \*-iyu- developed similarly to the sequences \*-uwa- and \*-iya-, becoming monosyllabic in all dialects except Matu'uwal. In Plngawan, it regularly coalesced into a monophthong /i/, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-iyu.

| Squliq       | s**əm**yuk     | gyus    | ləlyuŋ    | sənyuw    |

Some words in Plngawan do not exhibit the change of \*-iyu- to /i/, for example, Proto-Atayal \*siniyug 'rope' > Plngawan *sinyuw*. It should be noted that the sequences [ju] and [iw] can sound very similar, however I recorded the form *sinyuw* as [ɕi.ˈnjuː], with the syllable peak on /u/ and the vowel itself lengthened. Here, I believe the rule was underapplied to avoid the infelicitous sequence /iw/, much like with *syaw* 'rim, edge'.

There is one Plngawan word in my dataset where coalescence did not occur when expected: *lahyuŋ* 'mortar'. It is an outlier, but unlike *sinyuw* 'rope', it does not have an environment that would explain the sound change not being applied here (/hiŋ/ is a valid syllable in Plngawan, e.g. *l**um**uhiŋ* 'to continue', so it cannot have been to avoid an infelicitous syllable).

### Prepenultimate vowel correspondences {#sec:prepenult-vowel-correspondences}

Of the seven dialects under discussion here, only Matu'uwal, Plngawan, and Matu'aw still preserve phonemic distinctions in the third-to-last vowel (see [@sec:matuuwal-phonotactics;@sec:plngawan-phonotactics;@sec:matuaw-phonotactics]). It is thus possible to reconstruct vowels in the third-to-last syllable and even beyond, by using the evidence from these three dialects. In this section, I will specifically concentrate on third-to-last vowels, partly because very few roots are longer than three syllables, and partly because fourth-to-last vowels present different challenges due to vowel lenition processes.

In many cases, all three dialects agree on the third-to-last vowel, in which case the reconstruction is straightforward. The Proto-Atayal vowels \*a, \*i, and \*u can all be reconsructed this way, as shown in @tbl:prepen-same-vowel.

Many of the protoforms in @tbl:prepen-same-vowel have the segments \*q or \*ɹ, which have different reflexes in these dialects. All correspondences are regular, so we can be fairly certain these words were directly inherited.

Alternations of Proto-Atayal \*ə in the final syllable of verbal roots were discussed in @sec:historical-schwa-alternations. There were also verbs with \*ə in the initial syllable of disyllabic roots, which did not surface in Matu'uwal and Plngawan when the verb was prefixed or infixed, but did appear in suffixed forms. It is reflected as /a/ in most cases, as seen in @tbl:cecvc-verbs-ml-pl.^[I do not have sufficient Matu'aw data to include it in the table, but I expect all instances of \*ə to regularly become /a/ regardless of position, for example, Proto-Atayal \*kələh**un** 'to reap (PV)' > Matu'aw *kalah**un***.]

| \text{*}kələh**un** | kalh**un**   | kilh**un**  | 'to reap (PV)'       |

When \*ə in the initial syllable of the root was followed by \*ɹ, its reflex in Matu'uwal is ∅ due to the regular deletion of \*ɹ: Proto-Atayal \*həɹiʔ**an** 'to pour (LV)' > Matu'uwal *hiʔ**an***, cf. Plngawan *haɹeʔ**an***. Likewise, \*ə followed by \*q did not surface in suffixed forms in Plngawan: Proto-Atayal \*ləqiŋ**un** 'to hide s.t. (PV)' > Plngawan *liŋ**un***, cf. Matu'uwal *laqiŋ**un***.

The verbs 'to accompany' and 'to reap' appear to be exceptions here in that Plngawan reflects /i/ instead of the regular /a/ in suffixed forms. This is most likely environmentally conditioned, although with only two items, it is difficult to properly generalize the environment.

There are also instances of two dialects agreeing with each other, but disagreeing with the third, for example when Matu'uwal and Matu'aw have the same third-to-last vowel, but Plngawan has a different one. When comparing such evidence, it should be noted that Matu'uwal and Matu'aw are spoken in close geographical proximity, and there is interaction and intermarriage between the two communities. Therefore, a simple majority rule cannot be used here (its use is best eschewed in general), and additional evidence is required.

In @tbl:diff-vowels-pl-a-ml-mw-u-i, Matu'uwal and Matu'aw have the vowel /u/ or /i/, but Plngawan has /a/ in its cognates. Here, we have evidence to reconstruct the vowel in Matu'uwal and Matu'aw to Proto-Atayal.

| \text{*}ɹimagal | ɹamagal  | ʔimagal   | yimagal | 'five'   |

There are several ways to help us determine the third-to-last vowel in these words. We can use both internal and external evidence: internal evidence comes from female register words in Matu'uwal or other dialects (the gender register system is explained in @sec:gender-register), and external evidence may come from Seediq or from PAn reconstructions (see also @sec:external-evidence-phono).

Here we have internal evidence in the form of female register forms in Matu'uwal: *luhuŋ* 'mortar' and *guquh* 'banana' (both forms are also found in Squliq and Skikun). Both these forms point to a /u/ phoneme in the initial syllable, and based on how the gender register morphology operates (most of the time using right-anchored infixes), we can generally assume the vowel in the initial syllable to remain unchanged. For the numeral 'five', we can look to the related word 'fifty' for evidence: Proto-Atayal \*maɹimal > Plngawan *maɹimal*, Matu'uwal and Matu'aw *maymal*. The numeral 'fifty' shows the vowel /i/ following /ɹ/ in Plngawan, so we can expect the numeral 'five' to share the same vowel, since the two forms share the same root and differ only in affixation.

External evidence corroborates internal evidence here. The female register form *luhuŋ* 'mortar' is descended directly from PAn \*Nusuŋ. The numeral 'five' has a cognate in Seediq *rima*, which comes from PAn \*lima.^[The numerals 2-5 in Atayal were formed using a process very similar to that of male register derivation, and so have additional segments on the right edge or near it.] The vowel in \*guhiluq cannot be supported by internal or external evidence, but is reconstructed here because it follows the same pattern.

In the correspondence set in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a, Matu'uwal has the vowel /i/ where Plngawan and Matu'aw have /a/. These words are disyllabic in Matu'uwal and Plngawan, but were originally trisyllabic in Proto-Atayal (and Matu'aw retained the three-syllable structure). The penultimate vowel in all these words was \*ə, which was regularly deleted in Matu'uwal and Plngawan in this position.

: Matu'uwal /i/ vs Plngawan and Matu'aw /a/ {#tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a}

| \text{*}gihəɹaq   | gihaaq    | gahɹaʔ   |           | 'cold'           |

In all Proto-Atayal forms in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a, the vowel in question was followed by \*h or \*ʔ, with a following \*ə. The vowel was either changed in Matu'uwal, or in both Plngawan and Matu'aw.

We know that verbs with Proto-Atayal \*ə in the initial syllable of the root have /a/ in that position in both Matu'uwal and Plngawan when suffixed (i.e. when \*ə was in the third-to-last syllable). This is also true of verbs with \*-əhə- in the root: Proto-Atayal \*bəhəl**an** 'to tie (LV)' > Matu'uwal and Plngawan *bahl**an***. In other words, Proto-Atayal \*ə in third-to-last position regularly becomes /a/ in both Matu'uwal and Plngawan. We thus know that the vowel in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a is not \*ə.

Here we can use distribution to help us figure out which dialects changed the vowel. Matu'uwal allows any cardinal vowel to occur in a non-final closed syllable with coda /ʔ/ or /h/: *baʔnux* 'flat', ***mu**hŋiq* 'to rest', ***ma**hnuk* 'soft'. On the other hand, in the 2000+ items that I have collected, there is not a single instance of /u/ or /i/ followed by coda /h/ in a penultimate syllable (coda /ʔ/ does not appear word-medially in Plngawan), although there are many examples of such syllables with the vowel /a/, such as those in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a. In Matu'aw, such syllables would not be closed, but would instead be followed by /a/ (< Proto-Atayal \*ə), but it also appears to lack high vowels in this environment. The conclusion here is that Plngawan and Matu'aw neutralized vowel distinctions in the environment \_[hʔ]əCVC, with all vowels in this position becoming /a/.
<!-- TODO: add sound change schema? -->

A similar correspondence can be found in a few other words, shown in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a-extra. Here, the same correspendence of Matu'uwal /i/ with Plngawan and Matu'aw /a/ can be seen, but the environment is different from the one seen in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a.

: Additional correspondences of Matu'uwal /i/ with Plngawan and Matu'aw /a/ {#tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a-extra}

| Proto-Atayal        | Matu'uwal   | Plngawan    | Matu'aw     | Gloss        |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| \text{*}kVtəhuɹ     | kithuw      | katuhuɹ     |             | 'fat, stout' |
| \text{*}ɹVkəhiʔ     | ʔikhiʔ      |             | yakahiʔ     | 'thin'       |
| \text{*}ɹVlahaŋ     | ʔilahaŋ     | ɹahalaŋ     | galahaŋ     | 'broad'      |
| \text{*}**m**Vŋilis | **m**iŋilis | **m**aŋilis | **m**aŋilis | 'to cry'     |

In the first two items, the penultimate vowel in Proto-Atayal was \*ə (the penultimate vowel in Plngawan *katuhuɹ* is irregular, cf. Squliq and Skikun *qətəhuy*, Klesan *təhuy*). This is similar to the data in @tbl:diff-vowels-ml-i-pl-mw-a, but the paucity of data prevents me from grouping these two words with the set with the environment \_[hʔ]əCVC. The environment may be broader, but more cognates are needed to say with certainty.

In the final two items, the penultima is a cardinal vowel, so this may be a different pattern (note also the consonant metathesis in Plngawan *ɹahalaŋ*). The verb 'to cry' is highly irregular: the base (negative/imperative AV) is *ʔiŋilis* in Matu'uwal, but *caŋilis* in Plngawan. Additionally, it metathesizes when suffixed: Matu'uwal *liŋisan*, Plngawan *caŋisan*. In view of an irregular paradigm and irregular correspondences between dialects, this form's reconstruction is uncertain.

There are also several words where /i/ in the third-to-last syllable in Plngawan corresponds to either /u/ or /a/ in Matu'uwal and Matu'aw. These are shown in @tbl:diff-vowels-pl-i-ml-mw-u-a. Most of these lack any supporting evidence to reconstruct the third-to-last vowel.

: Plngawan /i/ vs Matu'uwal and Matu'aw /u/ or /a/ {#tbl:diff-vowels-pl-i-ml-mw-u-a}

| Proto-Atayal     | Plngawan    | Matu'uwal      | Matu'aw      | Gloss           |

| \text{*}-bVciyak | **ma**bicek | s**um**baciyak |              | 'to strangle'   |

To reconstruct \*u in Proto-Atayal \*ruliyug 'point, top', we can use the female register form *rulug* in Matu'uwal. The derivational process here uses the right-anchored infix *-i-*, just like in the pair *luhug\~luhiyug* [@li1983, p. 9]. Likewise for \*səpiyal 'dream', a female register form *səpiʔ* is found in Squliq and Skikun. There is also a PAn reconstruction, but it is ambiguous with regard to the vowel in the initial syllable: \*Sipi/\*Səpi. Apart from that, the Plngawan verb 'to dream' has two pronunciations: ***ma**sipel* and ***ma**spel*. Since the vowel /i/ is not normally deleted in penultimate position, the form ***ma**spel* provides additional evidence to reconstruct the vowel \*ə here (whereas ***ma**sipel* is likely due to paradigm leveling). Using both the female register form in Squliq and Skikun, as well as the vowel reflexes in Matu'uwal *sapiyal* and Matu'aw *s**um**apyal* 'to dream' as evidence, the form \*səpiyal 'dream' should be reconstructed for Proto-Atayal.
<!-- TODO: that's not the regular Ml reflex of schwa! -->

The other words in @tbl:diff-vowels-pl-i-ml-mw-u-a do not have similar supporting evidence. In this situation, it is best to be overly cautious and not reconstruct specific vowels. However, based on the other examples in this section, Matu'uwal preserved vowels in this position most of the time, and Plngawan changed them more often, so I would expect the vowel in Proto-Atayal to be the same as in Matu'uwal and Matu'aw in these words.

## Proto-Atayal phoneme inventory {#sec:proto-atayal-phoneme-inventory}

With the individual sound correspondences in @sec:sound-correspondences completed, they can now be unified into a table showing the full phoneme inventory of Proto-Atayal. @tbl:proto-atayal-consonants displays all the consonant phonemes that can be reconstructed for Proto-Atayal.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Proto-Atayal consonant inventory}
\label{tbl:proto-atayal-consonants}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l } \toprule
p & t    & k & q & ʔ \\
b &      & g &   &   \\
  & c    &   &   &   \\
  & s    & x & h &   \\
m & n    & ŋ &   &   \\
  & l, r &   &   &   \\
w & y, ɹ &   &   &   \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Proto-Atayal had more phonemic distinctions than any of the extant Atayal dialects, which underwent various mergers but almost no splits in their consonants (with the possible exception of Squliq [ʑ], which has quasi-phonemic status in some varieties of Squliq, see @sec:sq-phonology). There was a gap in voiced plosives, since Proto-Atayal, like all Atayal dialects, lacked a /d/ phoneme: Proto-Atayalic \*d had changed to Proto-Atayal \*r, but not before Proto-Atayalic \*r had changed to Proto-Atayal \*ɹ, thereby avoiding a merger.

There were thus two rhotics in Proto-Atayal: \*r and \*ɹ. We can determine the fact that \*ɹ was an approximant from its reflexes. Most importantly, Plngawan still reflects it as a separate phoneme /ɹ/. Other dialects merge it with /w/ or \<y\> /j/ where it is not deleted, the common feature being that /w/ and \<y\> /j/ are both approximants. On the other hand, Proto-Atayal \*r is still regularly reflected as /r/ in all dialects (except for instances of assimilation or neutralization in specific environments).

Proto-Atayal \*b was most likely a plosive, though it may have had fricative allophones in certain positions, especially intervocalically. Not only can it still be realized as a plosive [b] in Plngawan, Klesan, and Skikun ([@sec:plngawan-consonants;@sec:culi-consonants;@sec:skikun-consonants]), but when it was devoiced word-finally in all dialects except Matu'uwal, it became /p/ and not /f/.

By analogy with \*b, we might assume that Proto-Atayal \*g was also plosive, and that was likely the case word-initially, to judge from Plngawan reflexes. In word-final position, \*g was probably already a fricative by Proto-Atayal, and likely even in Proto-Atayalic, judging from its reflexes in both Atayal and Seediq dialects. Unlike \*b, Proto-Atayal \*g did not become a voiceless plosive /k/ in any dialect, but instead merged variously with /x/, /w/, or ∅, depending on the dialect and the preceding vowel. The same pattern is also found in Truku Seediq, where the consonant /g/ becomes either [w] (after /a/ and /u/) or [j] (after /i/) [@lee2010, p. 152].

The vowel system of Proto-Atayal was quite simple, as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-vowels. The main difference between Proto-Atayal and modern dialects is the complete lack of mid vowels.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Proto-Atayal vowel inventory}
\label{tbl:proto-atayal-vowels}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c } \toprule
i     &      & u     \\
      & ə    &       \\
      & a    &       \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Proto-Atayal \*ə was limited to non-final syllables, whereas the remaining three vowels could occur in any syllable. There were also three "diphthongs" (VG sequences): \*aw, \*ay, and \*uy.

## Proto-Atayal phonotactics {#sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics}

Most phonemes in Proto-Atayal could occur in any position within the word, including word-finally. The voiceless velar fricative \*x was found in word-inital position in only a single word, \*xuɹil 'dog'. The vowel \*ə could not appear in the final syllable, but was allowed elsewhere: \*bəhut 'squirrel', \*kələh**un** 'to reap, to harvest (PV)'.

The affricate \*c could not appear word-finally.^[Note that in modern Atayal dialects, some speakers may pronounce word-final /t/ as an affricate \[t͡s\], however this is not a reflex of word-final \*c. This affricate pronunciation is purely phonetic, and affects all word-final /t/ segments for speakers that have it.] We can tell that word-final \*c was completely absent from Proto-Atayal by examining reflexes in S'uli and Matu'aw, which merge \*c and \*s into /s/. There are no instances of word-final /s/ in S'uli and Matu'aw corresponding to word-final /t/ or \<c\> [t͡s] in other dialects, and thus no evidence to reconstruct Proto-Atayal word-final \*c.

The syllable structure of Proto-Atayal was quite simple, with only CV and CVC syllables allowed. CVC syllables could only be word-final, except if the coda was a glide (CVG), in which case they could appear word-medially. Examples for each syllable type are given in @tbl:proto-atayal-syllable-types.

: Syllable types in Proto-Atayal {#tbl:proto-atayal-syllable-types}

| Syllable type | Example     | Gloss      |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| CV            | \*ba.gah    | 'charcoal' |
| CVG           | \*raw.ɹiq   | 'eyes'     |
| CVC           | \*ha.pu.niq | 'fire'     |
<!-- fixme: highlighting -->
<!-- here and in all other syllable type tables -->

<!-- Sed diyax 'day', swayi 'younger sibling', mkuung 'dark' -->
It generally seems that in content words, the final syllable was obligatorily closed. This was not necessarily the case for function words: Proto-Atayal \*cimu 'you (2PL.Nom)', \*ʔuɹi 'too, also', \*haca 'that'. However the Proto-Atayal verb \***m**ahi 'to hit' is an apparent counterexample to this tendency, and the lack of any root-final consonant can be seen in the PV form \*bahiy**un**. The imperative/negative PV/LV suffix \*-i likewise did not have a final consonant (see @sec:voice-system for a detailed description of the Proto-Atayal voice morphology).

Unlike its daughter language Matu'uwal, Proto-Atayal did not have a distinction between hiatuses (VV) and vowels with an intervening glottal stop (VʔV). This distinction arose in Matu'uwal after the deletion of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ. The glottal stop is preserved in Matu'uwal when (1) the two vowels were identical, as in ***ma**tbabaʔaŋ* 'crooked' or ***mə**nakuʔum* 'dark'; (2) when the first vowel was high and the second was low, as in *riʔax* 'day' or *ciʔax* 'light'; or (3) when the first vowel was a \*ə in Proto-Atayal, as in ***ma**sʔaŋ* 'to scold' (< \***ma**səʔaŋ). Other dialects only preserved glottal stops in the third environment, and sporadically elsewhere. Matu'uwal does not preserve root-internal glottal stops in the fourth environment---a low vowel followed by a high vowel---except in a single word *raʔuŋ* 'hook' and its derivatives, though verbs ending with /-aʔ/ always retain the glottal stop when suffixed, e.g. *gibaʔun* 'to hug, to embrace (PV)'. The Matu'uwal words *c**um**aʔiŋ* 'to sew' and *s**um**aʔiŋ* 'to reap' (and derivatives) appear to be exceptions, too, however these are male register form of the verbs *c**um**aqis* and *s**um**aqit*, respectively. No other dialect has these male register forms, so they must have been innovated in Matu'uwal after the loss of Proto-Atayal \*ʔ in the environment a\_i, thus creating a new contrast where it previously did not exist (see @sec:gender-register for an explanation of the gender register system in Atayal).

If we take Matu'uwal reflexes to be the same as the original Proto-Atayal^[Here we use Matu'uwal because all the other dialects deleted glottal stops in many environments where Matu'uwal did not.], then we would have a phonotactically imbalanced system, where hiatuses were allowed to occur only between a low vowel and a high vowel, and only inside a root. This would make them have a complementary distribution with VʔV sequences. It makes more sense to reconstruct a phonemic glottal stop between all adjacent vowels, since there is no evidence for reconstructing phonemically distinct VV and VʔV sequences. That being said, the actual pronunciation of glottal stops in this position likely varied, and may have been optional (due to the lack of a phonemic contrast with true vowel clusters), like it is in Plngawan or Klesan. Reconstructing glottal stops between adjacent vowels helps distinguish such sequences from vowels with an intervening glide. See @tbl:ia-iya-contrast for a comparison between Matu'uwal, which preserves the distinction between intervocalic glottal stops from glides, and Squliq and Skikun, which no longer contrast the two.

: Contrast between /iʔa/ and \<iya\> /ija/ in Atayal {#tbl:ia-iya-contrast}

| Proto-Atayal  | Matu'uwal | Squliq | Skikun | Gloss       |
|---------------|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| \text{*}ciʔax | ciʔax     | syax   | cyax   | 'light'     |
| \text{*}siyag | siyag     | syaw   | syax   | 'edge, rim' |

Proto-Atayal did not allow CG sequences. Instead, whenever we see such a sequence in a modern Atayal dialect, Proto-Atayal had a vowel between the two, homorganic with the glide. The evidence for this comes from Matu'uwal, which still preserves these vowels, from Plngawan reflexes of such vowels after \*q (where two vowels surface), and from Seediq, where not only are these vowels present, but they receive stress (stress in Seediq is penultimate): Proto-Atayal \*quwalax 'rain' > Matu'uwal *quwalax*, Plngawan *ʔawalax*, and Proto-Atayal \*ŋaquwaq 'mouth' > Matu'uwal *ŋaquwaq*, Plngawan *ŋawaʔ*, cf. Seediq *quwaq* [ˈqu.waq].

The "diphthongs" (VG sequences) \*aw and \*ay could occur in non-final syllables: \*rawɹiq 'eyes', \*wayluŋ 'chicken'. There are no instances of non-final \*uy in my data, though it is unclear if this was a phonotactic restriction, an accidental gap, or if my data is insufficient.

Stress in Proto-Atayal was fixed and word-final, like in all seven dialects under consideration.

## External evidence {#sec:external-evidence-phono}

Apart from internal evidence, i.e. Atayal reflexes, we can also utilize external evidence to corroborate our findings and make reconstructions more precise. Here I divide external evidence into two sources: Seediq and Proto-Austronesian.

Seediq is the most closely related language to Atayal, and the two share phonological and lexical innovations that cannot be found elsewhere. This makes Seediq an excellent source of additional evidence.

Proto-Austronesian is reconstructed based on evidence in many Austronesian languages, both in Taiwan and outside it (through the Malayo-Polynesian branch). It gives us a chronologically deep look into the workings of the family, but can help with some phonemes in Proto-Atayal specifically.

### Evidence from Seediq {#sec:evidence-from-seediq-phono}

Seediq provides supporting evidence for the syllabic structure described in @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics, namely disyllabic CVGVC sequences in such words as Proto-Atayal \*ŋaquwaq 'mouth', \*kuwiʔ 'insect', \*c**um**iyuk 'to answer, to respond', as opposed to reconstructing CGVC monosyllables. Stress in Seediq is penultimate [@tsukida2005, p. 293], thus the cognates of the aforementioned words are pronounced [ˈqu.waq] 'mouth', [ˈku.wi] 'insect', and [cə.ˈmi.yuk] 'to answer', respectively. The vowel preceding its homorganic glide receives stress in Seediq, which adds weight to evidence from Matu'uwal that a phonemic vowel was indeed present there in Proto-Atayal.

Seediq also supports reconstructing a \*ə vowel in Proto-Atayal, again thanks to its penultimate stress. The distribution of vowels in Seediq is the same as in Atayal, i.e. schwa does not appear in the final syllable, however penultimale schwa can receive stress [@tsukida2005, pp. 292-293]. This stressed schwa is generally regarded as phonemic. The presence of \*ə in Proto-Atayal is doubtless, due to the various reflexes in its daughter languages, though its phonemic status may be disputed.

Seediq can be used to support the reconstruction of certain phonemes, especially in etyma with insufficient internal evidence. In words without Plngawan reflexes, Seediq cognates can help identify the presence of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ (which corresponds to Seediq /r/), for example, in Proto-Atayal \*paɹih 'hoe' and \*k**um**aɹiʔ 'to dig', cf. Seediq *parih* and *k**əm**ari*, respectively (Truku dialect).

Another correspondence where Seediq is helpful is Proto-Atayal word-final \*-ig. No Atayal dialect preserves final \*g in this environment, however we do know that it existed in Proto-Atayal, based on Paul Li's notes on Matu'aw circa 1980, when it was still preserved by older speakers [@li1980;@li1981;@li1982b]. At the same time, not all instances of word-final long /iː/ can automatically be reconstructed as \*-ig (see discussion on \***m**ahi\~bahiy**un** in @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics). Several dialects of Seediq preserve a final /g/ or /r/ in these words, compare Proto-Atayal \*wahig 'vine' and Truku *wahir*, Proto-Atayal \***ma**baɹig 'to buy' and Seediq ***m**arig*, Proto-Atayal \*kəgig 'hemp, ramie' and Truku *kərig*.^[In Truku Seediq, phonemic /g/ undergoes lenition in word-final position, becoming \[w\] when preceded by /u/ or /a/, and \[j\] when preceded by /i/ [@lee2010, p. 152].]

I also used Seediq evidence to reconstruct Proto-Atayal word-final \*-lit in words with final /t/ in some dialects corresponding to /ʔ/ in others. Differences in the distribution of phonemes between Atayal dialects led me to reconstruct \*-t in Proto-Atayal, and Seediq cognates support that conclusion. See @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d for an in-depth explanation.

### Evidence from PAn reconstructions {#sec:evidence-from-pan-phono}

There are relatively few Proto-Austronesian etyma with reflexes in Atayal, and they rarely provide crucial evidence for reconstructing phonemes (they are more useful in determining lexical retentions, see @sec:evidence-from-pan-lexical). However, they can still serve as additional evidence for Proto-Atayal reconstructions. At the same time, care should be taken not to give too much weight to Proto-Austronesian reconstructions at the expense of internal evidence from Atayal.

In @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d I used PAn \*qaNiC 'skin, hide' as evidence against Li's argument for reconstructing \*d in Proto-Atayalic for words that variously have a reflex of /t/ or /ʔ/ in word-final position in different Atayal dialects. Li originally used the PAn etymon \*paNid 'wing' to argue that the origin of these reflexes was a voiced plosive that was lost in all dialects of Atayal and Seediq. PAn \*qaNiC 'skin, hide' supports an alternative hypothesis that the reflexes do not come from a unique phoneme, and are instead environmentally conditioned. See @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d for full discussion.

Proto-Austronesian \*l is reflected in Proto-Atayal as \*ɹ, for example PAn \*walay 'yarn' > Proto-Atayal \*waɹay. PAn protoforms can be used to reconstruct \*ɹ in Proto-Atayal in cases where internal evidence is insufficient, as in PAn \*Cali 'taro' > Proto-Atayal \*caɹiʔ, of which the only remaining reflex is Matu'uwal *caiʔ* (the other dialects all use a different form).

PAn etyma may provide additional evidence for reconstructing vowels, especially Proto-Atayal \*ə: PAn \*təlu 'three' > Proto-Atayal \*təɹugal, with an additional suffix *-gal*, cf. also Proto-Atayal \*matəɹuʔ 'six' and \*matəɹul 'thirty'. They may also be used when reconstructing vowels in the third-to-last syllable, as in PAn \*qaSəlu 'pestle' > Proto-Atayal \*qasəɹuʔ, or PAn \*qaRidaŋ 'beans, peas' > Proto-Atayal \*qagiraŋ 'cowpeas'. See [@sec:vowel-correspondences;@sec:prepenult-vowel-correspondences] for more information on reconstructing vowels.

Proto-Austronesian reconstructions can also help identify irregular correspondences in Atayal dialects. For example, PAn \*N is regularly reflected as Proto-Atayal \*l, so the correspondence of PAn \*wanaN 'right hand side' is regular in Plngawan and Matu'aw *ʔanaliʔ* (with an additional suffix *-iʔ*), but irregular in Matu'uwal *ʔanan*. Likewise, PAn \*C > Proto-Atayal \*c, so PAn \*baCaR 'proso millet' is regularly reflected in Skikun *bacyax*^[Some words in Skikun, S'uli, and Klesan have sporadic palatalization that most commonly affects the phonemes /s/ and \<c\> /t͡s/.] and S'uli *basaw*, while Matu'uwal *basag* is irregular. Regular correspondences of PAn protophonemes to Proto-Atayal are listed in @sec:pan-to-proto-atayal.

## Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Atayal dialects {#sec:proto-atayal-to-dialects}

This section lists all regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to each of the seven dialects under study. Chronological relationships between sound changes in the same dialect are given where applicable. Changes that only affect some speakers of a dialect, and sporadically recurring changes (i.e. non-systematic changes that occur in more than a single word), are mentioned separately.

The same sound change may occur in different dialects, but that does not necessarily mean that it is a shared innovation. Instead, we can prove that at least some of these identical sound changes happened independently. See Chapter 6 for more details.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Squliq {#sec:proto-atayal-to-sq}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Squliq can be indentified:

1. **\*c, \*s > s.** The affricate \*c fully and unconditionally merged into \*s: Proto-Atayal \*c**um**aqis 'to sew' > Squliq *s**əm**aqis*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Squliq *bisuw*.
2. **\*ɹ, \*y > y.** The retroflex approximant \*ɹ fully and unconditionally merged into \*y: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Squliq *yuŋay*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > Squliq *wayay*, Proto-Atayal \*malikuɹ 'man, husband' > Squliq *məlikuy*.
3. **\*t > c /\_i,y.** The coronal plosive \*t was affricated before the high front vowel or its corresponding glide: Proto-Atayal \*timuʔ 'salt' > Squliq *cimuʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*taɹasiʔ 'straw hat' > Squliq *cyasiʔ*. Strictly speaking, this \<c\> /t͡s/ is an allophone of /t/ in this position, but this change is useful in determining the relative chronology of other sound changes, see below.
4. **Vowel lenition.** Vowels outside the rightmost foot, i.e. third-to-last syllable and beyond, were lenited into /ə/: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Squliq *kəneril*, Proto-Atayal *turakis* 'foxtail millet' > Squliq *tərakis*, Proto-Atayal *pisaniq* 'taboo' > Squliq *pəsaniq*. This did not affect some words with \*ay in the third-to-last syllable, namely  Proto-Atayal \*baytaq**an** 'to stab (PV)' > Squliq *betaq**an***, Proto-Atayal \*-baytunux 'beautiful' > Squliq *betunux*, and maybe Proto-Atayal \*bVʔənux > Squliq *beʔənux* (though the vowel in the last etymon is uncertain). However, in other cases Squliq did not preserve \*ay in the same environment: Proto-Atayal \*tayhək**an** 'to arrive (LV)' > Squliq *təhək**an***, Proto-Atayal \*qayqayaʔ 'thing' > Squliq *qəqayaʔ* (cf. Plngawan *ʔayʔayaʔ*, Skikun *qeqayaʔ*).

   Note that in the AV infix *-əm-* and AV prefix *mə-* the vowel is lenited even if it falls on the penultimate syllable. The voice morphology is discussed in @sec:voice-system.
5. **Vowel coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \***mV**nakuʔum 'dark' > Squliq ***mə**nəkum*. When the penultima was a low vowel \*a, and the ultima a high vowel, they merged into a mid vowel: Proto-Atayal \*-raʔuŋ 'hook (for hanging things)' > Squliq ***kə**roŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*baʔis 'partner, spouse' > Squliq *bes*. When the penultima was a high vowel an the ultima a low vowel, the high vowel became a glide and the two syllables merged into a single CGVC syllable: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > Squliq *ryax*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.

   This process was combined with the **monophthongization of offglides** in the penultima. The offglides \*aw and \*ay were monophthongized into mid vowels, but only in the penultimate syllable: Proto-Atayal \*tawkan 'net bag carried on back' > Squliq *tokan*, Proto-Atayal \*haylag 'fast' > Squliq *helaw*.
6. **\*g > w /a\_#; > ∅ /V\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final \*-g was changed in one of two ways in Squliq, depending on the preceding vowel. When preceded by \*a, it merged with \*w: Proto-Atayal \*ʔurag 'dirt' > Squliq *ʔuraw*. When preceded by a high vowel, it was deleted, and the vowel was lengthened: Proto-Atayal \*kəgig 'hemp, ramie' > Squliq *kəgiy*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Squliq *bisuw*.
7. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced into /p/ in word-final position in Squliq: Proto-Atayal \*h**um**ab 'to stab, to spear' > Squliq *h**əm**ap*. In verbal roots, it can be seen after suffixation, see @sec:final-devoicing for more details.
8. **Rhotacism: \*s > r /i\_V́.** Proto-Atayal \*s becomes /r/ in Squliq under very specific conditions: only when it is preceded by \*i and followed by a stressed vowel (i.e. final vowel). For example, Proto-Atayal \*pisaʔ 'how many' > Squliq *piraʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*ʔisah 'older brother's wife' > Squliq *ʔirah*.

   If the vowel preceding \*s is anything other than \*i, rhotacism does not occur, e.g. Proto-Atayal \***m**usaʔ 'to go (AV)' > Squliq ***m**usaʔ*. Rhotacism is also blocked if \*s does not immediately precede stress: Proto-Atayal \*pisaniq 'taboo' > Squliq *pəsaniq*.

   Due to intraparadigmatic pressure, verbs with root-final /-is/ were not affected: Proto-Atayal \*c**um**aqis 'to sew (AV)' and \*caqis**un** 'to sew (PV)' > Squliq *s**əm**aqis* and *səqis**un***. However, the rule did affect verbs that had \*g to \*s alternation in Proto-Atayal (∅ to /s/ in most modern dialects, see @sec:other-consonant-alternations): Proto-Atayal \***ma**baɹig 'to buy (AV)' and \*baɹis**un** 'to buy (PV)' > Squliq ***mə**baziy* and *bəzir**un***.
9. **Liquid assimilation.** When a Proto-Atayal word had an onset \*r followed by an onset \*l, the first \*r became /l/ in Squliq: Proto-Atayal \*raluʔ 'name' > Squliq *laluʔ*. This rule was not applied when the second liquid was in coda position, either in the same syllable or in a different one: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Squliq *kəneril*, Proto-Atayal \*rapal 'sole (of foot)' > Squliq *rapal*.
10. **Dorsal harmony.** Proto-Atayal \*k became /q/ in Squliq if it was followed by \*q anywhere in the world, and sometimes when followed by \*h. The harmony with \*q was exceptionless, according to my data: Proto-Atayal \*-kuriq 'to steal' > Squliq ***mə**quriq* (cf. Klesan ***mə**kuri*), Proto-Atayal \*kisəliq 'to love, to like' > Squliq *qəsəliq* (cf. Matu'uwal *kisliq*). When followed by \*h, \*k was backed in some words, but not others: Proto-Atayal \*kVtəhuɹ 'fat, stout' > Squliq *qətəhuy*, Proto-Atayal \*kahuy 'tree' > Squliq *qahuy* 'firewood', Proto-Atayal \*k**um**ayhuɹ 'to dig' > Squliq *q**əm**ihuy*, but Proto-Atayal \*kuhiŋ 'head louse' > Squliq *kuhiŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*kəhuʔ 'granary' > Squliq *kəhuʔ*. Proto-Atayal \*k may also be sporadically backed into /q/ without any conditioning environment, see below for some examples.
11. **\*-lit > -liʔ.** In this very specific sound change, the Proto-Atayal final syllables \*-lit and \*-liʔ were merged into *-liʔ* in Squliq: Proto-Atayal \*qabulit 'ashes' > Squliq *qəbuliʔ*, cf. Plngawan *ʔabulit*. See @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d for a detailed explanation.
12. **Fortition of \*w before schwa.** In trisyllabic words where the first syllable began with \*w, it was fortitioned into a fricative: Proto-Atayal \*waqanux 'sambar deer' > Squliq *bəqanux*, Proto-Atayal \*waciluŋ 'pond, lake' > Squliq *bəsiluŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*wariyuŋ 'neck' > Squliq *gəryuŋ*. This was likely a repair strategy to avoid an illegal /wə/ sequence. The choice between /b/ and /g/ is unclear, as the aforementioned three lexical items are the only examples of this change.

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the above sound changes:

- 1 > 3 (merger of \*c and \*s preceded affrication of \*t): Proto-Atayal \*timuʔ 'salt' > Squliq *cimuʔ* instead of \*\*simuʔ.
- 2 > 3 (merger of \*ɹ and \*y preceded affrication of \*t): Proto-Atayal \*təɹugal 'three' > Squliq *cyugal* instead of \*\*tyugal (cf. Skikun *tyugal*).
- 4 > 5 (vowel lenition preceded vowel coalescence): Proto-Atayal \***mV**nakuʔum 'dark' > Squliq ***mə**nəkum* instead of \*\*mənakum.
- 8 > 1 (rhotacism preceded merger of \*c and \*s): Proto-Atayal \*bicug > Squliq *bisuw* instead of \*\*biruw.
- 4 > 12 (vowel lenition preceded \*w fortition): Proto-Atayal \*waqanux > Squliq *bəqanux* instead of \*\*wəqanux.

Apart from the regular sound changes described above, other changes in Squliq may be identified, but may be limited to certain speakers, or else sporadic:

- Word-final \*l may be merged into /n/, especially by younger speakers.
- Proto-Atayal \*k may be backed into /q/ sporadically and without any conditioning factors: Proto-Atayal \*kuwalit 'eagle' > Squliq *qwaliʔ*. More prominently, this happened in the nominal case markers and qeictics of Squliq: compare Squliq *qu* and Matu'uwal *ku*, both nominative case markers; or Squliq *qani* 'this' and *qasa* 'that' with Plngawan *kani* 'this' and *kaca* 'that'.
- The glide \<y\> /j/ has a fricative allophone [ʑ] that may be analyzed as a marginal phoneme in some varieties of Squliq, but not in others [@huang2015a].
- In parallel with \<y\> /j/, /w/ may also be optionally fortitioned into /g/ even when followed by cardinal vowels. This gives rise to variant forms such as *wagiʔ* and *gwagiʔ* 'Sun' (< Proto-Atayal \*wagiʔ), or *wagiq* and *gwagiq* 'tall' (< Proto-Atayal \*bawiq). Due to the optional nature and limited distribution of this change, it is likely more recent than \<y\> /j/ allophony.
- Some apparently irregular correspondences may also be explained through the regularization of irregular verbal paradigms. This is discussed in detail in @sec:paradigm-leveling.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to S'uli {#sec:proto-atayal-to-su}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to S'uli can be indentified:

1. **\*c, \*s > s.** The affricate \*c fully and unconditionally merged into \*s: Proto-Atayal \*c**um**iyuk 'to reply, to answer' > S'uli *s**əm**yuk*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > S'uli *bisuw*.
2. **\*q, \*ʔ > ʔ.** Proto-Atayal \*q merged into the glottal stop /ʔ/ in S'uli: Proto-Atayal \*qawlit 'mouse' > S'uli *ʔolit*, Proto-Atayal \*taquɹ 'crow' > S'uli *taʔuy*.
3. **\*ɹ, \*y > y.** The retroflex approximant \*ɹ fully and unconditionally merged into \*y: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > S'uli *yuŋay*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > S'uli *wayay*, Proto-Atayal \*qihuɹ 'horn' > S'uli *ʔihuy*.
4. **\*l, \*n > n /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*l merges with \*n word-finally: Proto-Atayal \*xuɹil 'dog' > S'uli *huzin*. Unlike other dialects, where this merger is mostly limited to younger, more innovative speakers, this sound change is S'uli appears complete.
5. **Vowel lenition.** Vowels outside the rightmost foot, i.e. third-to-last syllable and beyond, were lenited into /ə/: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > S'uli *kənerin*, Proto-Atayal *turakis* 'foxtail millet' > S'uli *tərakis*, Proto-Atayal *pisaniq* 'taboo' > S'uli *pəsani*. The apparent exception *betunux* 'pretty, beautiful' (< Proto-Atayal \*-baytunux) may be due to influence from Squliq.

   Note that in the AV infix *-əm-* and AV prefix *mə-* the vowel is lenited even if it falls on the penultimate syllable. The voice morphology is discussed in @sec:voice-system.
6. **Vowel coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \*biʔiŋ 'to hold in hand' > S'uli *biŋ*.^[S'uli *məkuʔum* 'dark' (< Proto-Atayal \*mVnakuʔum) is an exception to this rule.] When the penultima was a high vowel an the ultima a low vowel, the high vowel became a glide and the two syllables merged into a single CGVC syllable: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > S'uli *ryax*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.

   When the penultima was a low vowel \*a, and the ultima a high vowel, the two syllables first merged into a single syllable with an offglide. This offglide was later monophthongized into mid vowels (rule 11), but not before the deletion of final glottal stops (rule 10). Thus we see Proto-Atayal \*raʔum 'needle' > S'uli *rom*, Proto-Atayal \*baʔis 'partner, spouse' > S'uli *bes*, but Proto-Atayal \*suwaʔiʔ 'younger sibling' > S'uli *sway*.
7. **\*g > w /a\_#; > ∅ /V\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final \*-g was changed in one of two ways in S'uli, depending on the preceding vowel. When preceded by \*a, it merged with \*w: Proto-Atayal \*siyag 'edge, rim' > S'uli *syaw*. When preceded by a high vowel, it was deleted: Proto-Atayal \*kəgig 'hemp, ramie' > S'uli *kəgi*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > S'uli *bisu*.
8. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced into /p/ in word-final position in S'uli: Proto-Atayal \***ma**suɹab 'to yawn' > S'uli ***mə**suyap*. In verbal roots, it can be seen after suffixation, see @sec:final-devoicing for more details.
9. **Liquid assimilation.** When a Proto-Atayal word had an onset \*r followed by an onset \*l, the first \*r became /l/ in S'uli: Proto-Atayal \*raluʔ 'name' > S'uli *lalu*. This rule was not applied when the second liquid was in coda position, either in the same syllable or in a different one (although in S'uli \*l > n word-finally, see rule 4): Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > S'uli *kənerin*, Proto-Atayal \***masi**raŋil > S'uli ***məsə**raŋin*.
10. **\*ʔ > ∅ /\_#.** Glottal stops were lost in word-final position in S'uli: Proto-Atayal \*kəhuʔ 'granary' > S'uli *kəhu* (see also @sec:suli-phonotactics). This influenced vowel coalescence, so that vowel sequences preceding a final glottal stop did not coalesce, but instead remained as offlides: Proto-Atayal \*suwaʔiʔ 'younger sibling' > S'uli *sway* (cf. Squliq *səsweʔ*, Klesan *səswe*). This also affected words with final \*q in Proto-Atayal: Proto-Atayal \*raraʔuq 'low, short' > S'uli *rəraw* (cf. Squliq *rəroq*, Klesan *rərow*).
11. **Monophthongization of offglides.** The offglides \*aw and \*ay were monophthongized into mid vowels, unless they were word-final: Proto-Atayal \*rawɹiq 'eyes' > S'uli *rozi*, Proto-Atayal \*haylag 'fast' > S'uli *helaw*.

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the sound changes in S'uli:

- 5 > 6 (vowel lenition preceded vowel coalescence): Proto-Atayal \*galaʔiŋ 'front' > S'uli *gəleŋ* instead of \*\*galeng.
- 6 > 2 (vowel coalescence preceded \*q > ʔ): Proto-Atayal \*baq**un** 'to know (PV) > S'uli *baʔ**un*** instead of \*\*bon.
- 2 > 10 (\*q > ʔ preceded loss of final glottal stops): Proto-Atayal \*raraʔuq 'low, short' > S'uli *rəraw* instead of \*\*rəroʔ.
- 10 > 11 (loss of final glottal stops preceded the monophthongization of offglides): Proto-Atayal \*suwaʔiʔ 'younger sibling' > S'uli *sway* instead of \*\*swe.

Some phonological phenomena that do not qualify as systematic sound changes include:

- The central vowel /ə/ may be lowered to /a/ and merge with it completely in the speech of some speakers.
- The palatal glide \<y\> /j/ has a fricative allophone [ʑ] before the vowel /i/. Its distribution is more limited than the similar allophone in Squliq.
- The sound change **t > c /\_i** seemingly appears in some words, but not others, and sometimes two variants of a single word may be accepted, e.g. *tugan* or *cyugan* 'three', *byatiŋ* or *byaciŋ* 'moon'. Since the data does not show a systematic change (and moreover there are even competing variants), the affrication is most likely due to influence from Squliq.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Skikun {#sec:proto-atayal-to-sk}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Skikun can be indentified:

1. **\*ɹ, \*y > y.** The retroflex approximant \*ɹ fully and unconditionally merged into \*y: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Skikun *yuŋay*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > Skikun *wayay*, Proto-Atayal \*malikuɹ 'man, husband' > Skikun *məlikuy*.
2. **\*t > c /\_i.** The coronal plosive \*t was affricated before the high front vowel or its corresponding glide: Proto-Atayal \*timuʔ 'salt' > Skikun *cimuʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*qalətiŋ 'wooden plank' > Skikun *qələciŋ*. Unlike Squliq, \*ɹ > y did not cause a preceding \*t to affricate: Proto-Atayal \*taɹasiʔ 'straw hat' > Skikun *tyasiʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*təɹugal 'three' > Skikun *tyugal*.
3. **Vowel lenition.** Vowels outside the rightmost foot, i.e. third-to-last syllable and beyond, were lenited into /ə/: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Skikun *kəneril*, Proto-Atayal *turakis* 'foxtail millet' > Skikun *tərakis*, Proto-Atayal *pisaniq* 'taboo' > Skikun *pəsaniq*. There are at least two exceptions with \*ay in the third-to-last syllable: Proto-Atayal \*-baytunux 'beautiful' > Skikun *betunux*, Proto-Atayal \*qayqayaʔ 'thing' > Skikun *qeqayaʔ*.

   Note that in the AV infix *-əm-* and AV prefix *mə-* the vowel is lenited even if it falls on the penultimate syllable. The voice morphology is discussed in @sec:voice-system.
4. **Vowel coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \***mV**nakuʔum 'dark' > Skikun ***mə**nəkum*. When the penultima was a low vowel \*a, and the ultima a high vowel, they merged into a mid vowel: Proto-Atayal \*-raʔuŋ 'hook (for hanging things)' > Skikun *rəroŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*baʔis 'partner, spouse' > Skikun *bes*. When the penultima was a high vowel an the ultima a low vowel, the high vowel became a glide and the two syllables merged into a single CGVC syllable: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > Skikun *ryax*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.

   This process was combined with the **monophthongization of offglides** in the penultima. The offglides \*aw and \*ay were monophthongized into mid vowels, but only in the penultimate syllable: Proto-Atayal \*tawkan 'net bag carried on back' > Skikun *tokan*, Proto-Atayal \*haylag 'fast' > Skikun *helax*.
5. **\*g devoicing.** Proto-Atayal \*g was regularly devoiced in word-final position, merging with \*x: Proto-Atayal \*muɹag 'house' > Skikun *muyax*, Proto-Atayal \*siniyug 'rope' > Skikun *sənyux*. Word-finally after \*i, \*g was deleted instead, with compensatory lengthening on the vowel: Proto-Atayal \*tulaqig 'eel' > Skikun *təlaqiy*. This deletion may have taken place prior to devoicing.

   Skikun /g/ is also quite frequently devoiced word-initially, and /x/ voiced intervocalically, to the point where it may no longer be necessary to separate them into two phonemes. However, this problem requires additional study before drawing a conclusion one way or the other. See also discussion in @sec:skikun-consonants.
6. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced into /p/ in word-final position in Skikun: Proto-Atayal \*h**um**ab 'to stab, to spear' > Skikun *h**əm**ap*. In verbal roots, \*b will generally surface as /b/ after suffixation, see @sec:final-devoicing for more details.
7. **Liquid assimilation.** When a Proto-Atayal word had an onset \*r followed by an onset \*l, the first \*r became /l/ in Skikun: Proto-Atayal \*raluʔ 'name' > Skikun *laluʔ*. This rule was not applied when the second liquid was in coda position, either in the same syllable or in a different one: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Skikun *kəneril*, Proto-Atayal \*rapal 'sole (of foot)' > Skikun *rapal*.
8. **Dorsal harmony.** Proto-Atayal \*k became /q/ in Skikun if it was followed by \*q anywhere in the world. The harmony with \*q was exceptionless, according to my data: Proto-Atayal \*-kuriq 'to steal' > Skikun ***mə**quriq* (cf. Klesan ***mə**kuri*), Proto-Atayal \*kisəliq 'to love, to like' > Skikun *qəsəliq* (cf. Matu'uwal *kisliq*). It was also backed in Proto-Atayal \*kVtəhuɹ 'fat, stout' > Skikun *qətəhuy*, and Proto-Atayal \*-kapah 'to stick' > Skikun *q**əm**apah*, but unlike Squliq, there is no systematic backing of \*k before \*q, so these two words may be borrowed from Squliq.
9. **\*-lit > -liʔ.** In this very specific sound change, the Proto-Atayal final syllables \*-lit and \*-liʔ were merged into *-liʔ* in Skikun: Proto-Atayal \*qabulit 'ashes' > Skikun *qəbuliʔ*, cf. Plngawan *ʔabulit*. See @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d for a detailed explanation.
10. **Fortition of \*w before schwa.** In trisyllabic words where the first syllable began with \*w, it was fortitioned into a fricative: Proto-Atayal \*waqanux 'sambar deer' > Skikun *bəqanux*, Proto-Atayal \*waciluŋ 'pond, lake' > Skikun *bəciluŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*wariyuŋ 'neck' > Skikun *gəryuŋ*. This was likely a repair strategy to avoid an illegal /wə/ sequence. The choice between /b/ and /g/ is unclear, as the aforementioned three lexical items are the only examples of this change. The words are also identical to those in Squliq, but with a regular correspondence of \<c\> /t͡s/ and /s/ between Skikun *bəciluŋ* and Squliq *bəsiluŋ* 'pond, lake'.

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the sound changes in Skikun:

- 3 > 4 (vowel lenition preceded vowel coalescence): Proto-Atayal \***mV**nakuʔum 'dark' > Skikun ***mə**nəkum* instead of \*\*mənakum.
- 3 > 10 (vowel lenition preceded \*w fortition): Proto-Atayal \*waqanux > Skikun *bəqanux* instead of \*\*wəqanux.

The following are ongoing and spontaneous changes in Skikun:

- Word-final \*l may be merged into /n/ in Skikun, especially by younger speakers, though more conservative speakers still retain the distinction.
- The phoneme \<c\> /t͡s/ or /s/ was spontaneously palatalized in some words: Proto-Atayal \***ma**culiŋ 'to burn (intr.)' > Skikun ***mə**cyuliŋ*; Skikun *cyuŋaʔ*, cf. Matu'uwal *cuŋaʔ*; Skikun *syupan* 'bottle', cf. Klesan *supan*.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Klesan {#sec:proto-atayal-to-cu}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Klesan can be indentified:

1. **\*q, \*ʔ > ʔ.** Proto-Atayal \*q merged into the glottal stop /ʔ/ in Klesan: Proto-Atayal \*qawlit 'mouse' > Klesan *ʔolit*, Proto-Atayal \*taquɹ 'crow' > Klesan *taʔuy*.
2. **\*ɹ, \*y > y.** The retroflex approximant \*ɹ fully and unconditionally merged into \*y: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Klesan *yuŋay*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > Klesan *wayay*, Proto-Atayal \*malikuɹ 'man, husband' > Klesan *məlikuy*.
3. **Vowel lenition.** Vowels outside the rightmost foot, i.e. third-to-last syllable and beyond, were lenited into /ə/: Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Klesan *kənerin*, Proto-Atayal *turakis* 'foxtail millet' > Klesan *tərakis*, Proto-Atayal *pisaniq* 'taboo' > Klesan *pəsani*.

   Note that in the AV infix *-əm-* and AV prefix *mə-* the vowel is lenited even if it falls on the penultimate syllable. The voice morphology is discussed in @sec:voice-system.
4. **Vowel coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \***m**iʔiŋ 'to hold in hand' > Klesan ***m**iŋ*. When the penultima was a low vowel \*a, and the ultima a high vowel, they merged into a mid vowel: Proto-Atayal \*kaʔur 'Taiwan beauty snake (錦蛇)' > Klesan *kor*, Proto-Atayal \*baʔis 'partner, spouse' > Klesan *bes*. When the penultima was a high vowel an the ultima a low vowel, the high vowel became a glide and the two syllables merged into a single CGVC syllable: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > Klesan *ryax*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.

   This process was combined with the **monophthongization of offglides** in the penultima. The offglides \*aw and \*ay were monophthongized into mid vowels, but only in the penultimate syllable: Proto-Atayal \*tawkan 'net bag carried on back' > Klesan *tokan*, Proto-Atayal \*haylag 'fast' > Klesan *helaw*.
5. **\*m > ng /\_#; \*p > k /\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final labials merged into velars: Proto-Atayal \*raʔum 'needle' > Klesan *roŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*k**um**əɹap 'to grab' > Klesan *k**əm**əyak*. See also @sec:merger-labial-velar for examples of synchronic alternations caused by this sound change.
6. **\*g > w /a\_#; > ∅ /V\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final \*-g was changed in one of two ways in Klesan, depending on the preceding vowel. When preceded by \*a, it merged with \*w: Proto-Atayal \*ʔurag 'dirt' > Klesan *ʔuraw* 'earth'. When preceded by a high vowel, it was deleted: Proto-Atayal \*kəgig 'hemp, ramie' > Klesan *kəgi*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Klesan *bicyu* (with spontaneous palatalazation of \<c\> /t͡s/, see below).
7. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced into /p/ in word-final position in Klesan. Later, it shifted to a velar place of articulation (rule 5): Proto-Atayal \*pahəgub > Klesan *pəhəguk*.
8. **Liquid assimilation.** When a Proto-Atayal word had an onset \*r followed by an onset \*l, the first \*r became /l/ in Klesan: Proto-Atayal \*raluʔ 'name' > Klesan *lalu*. This rule was not applied when the second liquid was in coda position, either in the same syllable or in a different one (although in Klesan generally changed \*l > n word-finally): Proto-Atayal \*kanayril 'woman' > Klesan *kənerin*, Proto-Atayal \*rapal 'sole (of foot)' > Klesan *rapan*.
9. **\*ʔ > ∅ /\_#.** Glottal stops were lost in word-final position in Klesan: Proto-Atayal \*kəhuʔ 'granary' > Klesan *kəhu* (see also @sec:culi-phonotactics). Unlike S'uli, vowel coalescence was not affected by this change: Proto-Atayal \*kaʔiʔ 'speech, language' > Klesan *ke* (cf. S'uli *kay*).

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the sound changes in Klesan:

- 7 > 5 (final \*b devoicing preceded final labial to velar merger): Proto-Atayal \*pahəgub > Klesan *pəhəguk* instead of \*\*pəhəgu.
- 4 > 9 (vowel coalescence preceded final glottal stop deletion): Proto-Atayal \*kaʔiʔ > Klesan *ke* instead of \*\*kay.

There are also some irregular or ongoing sound changes in Klesan:

- Word-final \*l may be merged into /n/. According do data in @li1998, \*l may be preserved word-finally in some Klesan-speaking villages, although the reflexes he gives are not systematic. For more information, see @sec:culi-consonants.
- The sound change **t > c /\_i** appears in some words, but not others, and sometimes two variants of a single word may be accepted, e.g. *tisan* and *cisan* 'to visit'. Since the data does not show a systematic change (and since there are even competing variants), the affrication is most likely due to influence from Squliq.
- The phoneme \<c\> /t͡s/ or /s/ was spontaneously palatalized in some words: Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Klesan *bicyu*, Proto-Atayal \*cacaping 'broom' > Klesan *cyapiŋ* 'a plant used to make brooms', Proto-Atayal \***ma**culing 'to burn' > Klesan *cyuliŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*sasiq 'shade' > Klesan *syasi*.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Matu'aw {#sec:proto-atayal-to-mw}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Matu'aw can be indentified:

1. **\*c, \*s > s.** The affricate \*c fully and unconditionally merged into \*s: Proto-Atayal \*c**um**aqis 'to sew' > Matu'aw *s**um**aʔis*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Matu'aw *bisuw*.
2. **\*q, \*ʔ > ʔ.** Proto-Atayal \*q merged into the glottal stop /ʔ/ in Matu'aw: Proto-Atayal \*qaʔum 'pangolin' > Matu'aw *ʔawm*, Proto-Atayal \*taquɹ 'crow' > Matu'aw *taʔuy*.
3. **Vowel/syllable coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \*hiʔiʔ 'meat, flesh' > Matu'aw *hiʔ*.^[Matu'aw ***ma**nakuʔum* 'foggy' (< Proto-Atayal \***mV**nakuʔum) is an exception to this rule.]

   When one of the vowels was high and the other low, the high vowel became a glide and the two syllables merged into a single syllable, either CGVC or CVGC: Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > Matu'aw *ryax*, Proto-Atayal \*qaʔum 'pangolin' > Matu'aw *ʔawm*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.
4. **\*ɹ, \*y > y.** The retroflex approximant \*ɹ fully and unconditionally merged into \*y: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Matu'aw *yuŋay*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > Matu'aw *wayay*, Proto-Atayal \*malikuɹ 'man, husband' > Matu'aw *mamalikuy* 'young man'.
5. **\*ə, \*a > a.** Proto-Atayal schwa was fully merged with \*a: Proto-Atayal \*qasəɹuʔ 'pestle' > Matu'aw *ʔasayuʔ*.
6. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced into /p/ in word-final position in Matu'aw: Proto-Atayal \*h**um**agub 'to scry, to practice shamanism' > Matu'aw *h**um**agup*. In verbal roots, /b/ resurfaces after suffixation, see @sec:final-devoicing for more details.
7. **Lenition of word-final \*g.** As recently as 1980, conservative Matu'aw speakers still preserved word-final /g/ after all vowels, including /i/, according to data collected by Li [-@li1980;@li1981;@li1982b]. This sound has since disappeared from the language in exactly the same way as other dialects, by merging with /w/ after /a/, and by merging with ∅ and lengthening a preceding vowel after /u/ and /i/: Proto-Atayal \*tulaqig 'eel' > Matu'aw *tulaʔiy*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Matu'aw *bisuw*, Proto-Atayal \*s**um**amag 'to make the bed' > Matu'aw *s**um**amaw*.

Only one chronological ordering is needed for Matu'aw sound changes:

- 3 > 2 (vowel/syllable coalescence preceded \*q > ʔ): Proto-Atayal \***m**aqut 'to ask' > Matu'aw ***m**aʔut* instead of \*\*mawt.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Plngawan {#sec:proto-atayal-to-pl}

The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Plngawan can be indentified:

1. **\*q, \*ʔ > ʔ.** Proto-Atayal \*q merged into the glottal stop /ʔ/ in Plngawan: Proto-Atayal \*qawlit 'mouse' > Plngawan *ʔolit*, Proto-Atayal \*guqiluh 'banana' > Plngawan *gaʔiloh*.
2. **Changes of \*ə.** Proto-Atayal \*ə changed into a cardinal vowel or was deleted, depending on the environment. In trisyllabic words, penultimate \*ə was normally deleted and the word resyllabified: Proto-Atayal \*matəɹuʔ 'six' > Plngawan *matɹuʔ*. In disyllabic words, penultimate \*ə either became /a/ or copied the vowel in the final syllable: Proto-Atayal \*ɹəɹik 'deep' > Plngawan *ɹaɹik*, Proto-Atayal \*bəliŋ 'hole' > Plngawan *baliŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*bəhut 'squirrel' > Plngawan *buhut*, Proto-Atayal \*həɹiŋ 'honey, honeybees' > Plngawan *hiɹiŋ*. Sadly, there is not enough data to determine how the vowel was selected. See also correspondences of \*ə in @sec:vowel-correspondences.
3. **Vowel coalescence.** In Proto-Atayal words of the shape ...CVʔVC, i.e. with a glottal stop between the penultimate and ultimate vowel, and where the penultima was a cardinal vowel (not a schwa), the glottal stop was deleted and the vowel cluster resolved. When the vowels were identical, they merged into a single vowel with the same properties: Proto-Atayal \***mV**nakuʔum 'dark' > Plngawan ***mi**nakuŋ*. When one of the vowels was the low vowel \*a and another was a high vowel \*i or \*u, they merged into a mid vowel: Proto-Atayal \*-raʔuŋ 'hook (for hanging things)' > Plngawan *paparoŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*baʔis 'partner, spouse' > Plngawan *bes*, Proto-Atayal \*riʔax 'day' > Plngawan *rex*. See also @sec:vowel-coalescence for an overview of vowel coalescence in the synchronic grammars of various Atayal dialects.

   This process was combined with the **monophthongization of offglides** in the penultima. The offglides \*aw and \*ay were monophthongized into mid vowels, but only in the penultimate syllable: Proto-Atayal \*tawkan 'net bag carried on back' > Plngawan *tokan*, Proto-Atayal \*panayluq 'arrow' > Plngawan *paneluʔ*.

   Additionally, the sequences \*-uwa-, \*-iya-, and \*-iyu- were also monophthongized: Proto-Atayal \*-uwa- > Plngawan /o/, Proto-Atayal \*-iya- > Plngawan /e/, Proto-Atayal \*-iyu- > Plngawan /i/. Regular correspondences include Proto-Atayal \*giyus 'intestines' > Plngawan *gis*, Proto-Atayal \*qusiyaʔ 'water' > Plngawan *ʔuseʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*qaliyan 'daytime' > Plngawan *ʔalen*, Proto-Atayal \*buwax 'unhusked rice' > Plngawan *box*. The monophthongization of \*-iya- and \*-iyu was blocked before \*-g: Proto-Atayal \*siniyug 'rope' > Plngawan *sinyuw*, Proto-Atayal \*siyag 'edge, rim' > Plngawan *syaw*. When \*-uwa- was immediately preceded by \*q, it changed into /awa/ instead: Proto-Atayal \*quwalax 'rain' > Plngawan *ʔawalax*, but Proto-Atayal \*q**um**uwalax 'to rain (AV)' > Plngawan *ʔ**um**olax*. See also @sec:vowel-correspondences for more examples and explanation of these correspondences.
4. **\*m > ng /\_#; \*p > k /\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final labials merged into velars: Proto-Atayal \*raʔum 'needle' > Plngawan *roŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*k**um**əɹap 'to grab' > Plngawan *k**un**ɹak*. See also @sec:merger-labial-velar for examples of synchronic alternations caused by this sound change.
5. **Rhotacism: \*s > r /i\_V́.** Proto-Atayal \*s becomes /r/ in Plngawan under very specific conditions: only when it is preceded by \*i and followed by a stressed vowel (i.e. final vowel). For example, Proto-Atayal \*pisaʔ 'how many' > Plngawan *piraʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*ʔisah 'older brother's wife' > Plngawan *ʔirah*.

   If the vowel preceding \*s is anything other than \*i, rhotacism does not occur, e.g. Proto-Atayal \***m**usaʔ 'to go (AV)' > Plngawan ***m**usaʔ*. Rhotacism is also blocked if \*s does not immediately precede stress: Proto-Atayal \*pisaniq 'taboo' > Plngawan *pisaniʔ*.

   Due to intraparadigmatic pressure, verbs with root-final /-is/ were not affected: Proto-Atayal \*c**um**aqis 'to sew (AV)' and \*caqis**un** 'to sew (PV)' > Plngawan *c**um**aʔis* and *caʔis**un***. However, the rule did affect verbs that had \*g to \*s alternation in Proto-Atayal (∅ to /s/ in most modern dialects, see @sec:other-consonant-alternations): Proto-Atayal \*-baynay 'to buy (AV)' and \*binas**un** 'to buy (PV)' > Plngawan ***m**iniy* and *binar**un***. <!-- TODO: unsure about PA \*baynay here -->
6. **\*g > w /a\_#; > ∅ /V\_#.** Proto-Atayal word-final \*-g was changed in one of two ways in Plngawan, depending on the preceding vowel. When preceded by \*a, it merged with \*w: Proto-Atayal \*ʔurag 'dirt' > Plngawan *ʔuraw*. When preceded by a high vowel, it was deleted, and the vowel was lengthened: Proto-Atayal \*bunaqig 'sand' > Plngawan *bunaʔiy*, Proto-Atayal \*bicug 'worm' > Plngawan *bicuw*.
7. **\*b > p /\_#.** Proto-Atayal \*b was devoiced in word-final position in Plngawan, and its place of articulation then changed to velar (rule 4): Proto-Atayal \*-tVɹab 'tongs' > Plngawan ***pa**taɹak*. In verbal roots, the labial will surface after suffixation, though in Plngawan it is usually /p/ and not /b/, likely due to paradigm leveling between the application of the two sound changes, see @sec:paradigm-leveling for more details on paradigm leveling.
8. **\*ay > iy /\_#.** The Proto-Atayal offglide \*ay changed to /iː/ (written \<iy\>) in word-final position: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Plngawan *ɹuŋiy*, Proto-Atayal \*waɹay 'yarn' > Plngawan *waɹiy*. See also @sec:vowel-correspondences.

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the sound changes in Plngawan:

- 3 > 1 (vowel coalescence preceded \*q > ʔ): Proto-Atayal \*c**um**aqis 'to sew (AV)' > Plngawan *c**um**aʔis* instead of \*\*cumes.
- 7 > 4 (final \*b devoicing preceded final labial to velar merger): Proto-Atayal \*-tVɹab 'tongs' > Plngawan ***pa**taɹak* instead of \*\*pataɹaw.

### Sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Matu'uwal {#sec:proto-atayal-to-ml}

Matu'uwal has had relatively few sound changes, compared to the other dialects. The following regular sound changes from Proto-Atayal to Matu'uwal can be indentified:

1. **Changes of \*ɹ.** Proto-Atayal \*ɹ changed in several ways in Matu'uwal, depending on the environment and, in one case, on the subdialect.

   The regular correspondence of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ in most cases in Matu'uwal is ∅. Word-finally, it was deleted and the preceding vowel lengthened: Proto-Atayal \*raŋaɹ 'deadfall trap' > Matu'uwal *raŋa* [ra.ˈŋaː], Proto-Atayal \*lihuɹ 'forehead' > Matu'uwal *lihuw* [li.ˈħuː].^[Note that long high vowels are typically marked with a corresponding glide, however long low vowels are left unmarked. These contrast with words ending in a final glottal stop.] Between vowels, it was deleted, leading either to a hiatus (with identical vowels or a low-high sequence), or an epenthetic glide (in a high-low sequence or between two different high vowels): Proto-Atayal \*buɹul 'loincloth' > Matu'uwal *buul*, Proto-Atayal \*kaɹal 'sky' > Matu'uwal *kaal*, Proto-Atayal \*caɹiʔ 'taro' > Matu'uwal *caiʔ*, Proto-Atayal \***ma**sibaɹux 'to share field work' > Matu'uwal ***mə**sibaux*, Proto-Atayal \*xuɹil 'dog' > Matu'uwal *xuwil*, Proto-Atayal \*muɹag 'house, home' > Matu'uwal *ʔimuwag*.

   Word-initially, it was deleted before high vowels, with an epenthetic glottal stop being inserted to repair a vowel-initial word: Proto-Atayal \*ɹuŋay 'monkey' > Matu'uwal *ʔuŋay*, Proto-Atayal \*ɹiŋat 'to rob, to take away' > Matu'uwal *ʔiŋat*.^[This epenthetic glottal stop is phonemic and appears when the word is prefixed: *pataga-ʔuŋay* 'to become a monkey', *pa-ʔiŋac-an* 'to interrupt'.] Word-initially before a low vowel, it was either deleted like high vowels, or became /w/, depending on the subdialect. This led to two forms being acceptable to most speakers: Proto-Atayal \*ɹaŋaw 'housefly' > Matu'uwal *ʔangaw* or *wangaw*, Proto-Atayal \*ɹapit 'flying squirrel' > Matu'uwal *ʔapit* or *wapit*.

   Word-medially and immediately following the offglide \*aw, Proto-Atayal \*ɹ became /w/: Proto-Atayal \*rawɹiq 'eyes' > Matu'uwal *rawwiq*, Proto-Atayal \*g**um**awɹag 'to wade' > Matu'uwal *g**um**awwag*. Unlike word-initial reflexes, there is no variation here.
2. **Changes of \*ə.** Penultimate \*ə changed in several different ways in Matu'uwal. In disyllabic words, it was retained as /ə/: Proto-Atayal \*bəliŋ 'hole' > Matu'uwal *bəliŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*bəhut 'squirrel' > Matu'uwal *bəhut*.

   In trisyllabic words, penultimate \*ə was deleted, and the word resyllabified into CVC.CVC: Proto-Atayal \*ɹVkəlit 'leopard' > Matu'uwal *ʔakliʔ* or *wakliʔ*, Proto-Atayal \*qalətiŋ 'wooden plank' > Matu'uwal *qaltiŋ*.

   Immediately preceding \*ɹ, schwa assimilated to the following vowel after \*ɹ was deleted: Proto-Atayal \*həɹiŋ 'honey, honeybee' > Matu'uwal *hiiŋ*, Proto-Atayal \*matəɹuʔ 'six' > Matu'uwal *mamatuuʔ*.
3. **\*-aay > -aiy.** The word-final sequence \*-aay created by the deletion of \*ɹ was changed into *-aiy* /a.ˈiː/ instead: Proto-Atayal \*waɹay > Matu'uwal *waiy*. This also affected words with historical penultimate schwa: Proto-Atayal \*k**um**əɹay 'to dry (e.g. grass)' > Matu'uwal *k**um**aiy*.
<!-- TODO: add comment on Li's data? -->
4. **Dorsal harmony.** Proto-Atayal \*k became /q/ in Matu'uwal in disyllabic roots beginning with \*k and ending with \*q (kVCVq). This *k*-backing can only be found in three roots in my dataset: Proto-Atayal \*kaniq 'to eat (AV.SBJV)' > Matu'uwal *qaniq*, Proto-Atayal \*kuriq 'to steal (AV.SBJV)' > Matu'uwal *quriq*, Proto-Atayal \*kəbaq 'to know (AV.SBJV)' > Matu'uwal *qəbaq*. Unlike Squliq and Skikun, \*k was not backed in longer words or in other environments: Proto-Atayal \*kisəliq 'to like, to love' > Matu'uwal *kisliq* 'mood', Proto-Atayal \*kahuniq 'tree' > Matu'uwal *kahuniq*. See also @sec:consonant-correspondences for more reflexes of \*k.
5. **\*-lit > -liʔ.** In this very specific sound change, the Proto-Atayal final syllables \*-lit and \*-liʔ were merged into *-liʔ* in Matu'uwal: Proto-Atayal \*qabulit 'ashes' > Matu'uwal *qabuliʔ*, cf. Plngawan *ʔabulit*. See @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d for a detailed explanation.

The following ordering requirements can be defined for the sound changes in Matu'uwal:

- 1 > 2 (\*ɹ deletion preceded changes of \*ə): Proto-Atayal \*qasəɹuʔ > Matu'uwal *qasuuʔ* instead of \*\*qasuʔ.
- 2 > 3 (changes of \*ə preceded \*-aay > -aiy): Proto-Atayal \*k**um**əɹay > Matu'uwal *k**um**aiy* instead of \*\*kumiiy.

## Sound correspondences between Proto-Atayal and Proto-Atayalic {#sec:proto-atayalic-to-proto-atayal}

Proto-Atayalic is the ancestor language of Proto-Atayal and Proto-Seediq (and by extension, the closest common ancestor of all Atayal and Seediq dialects). A reconstruction of the phonology of Proto-Atayalic was first proposed by @li1981. This section describes the sound correspondences between Proto-Atayalic and its daughter language Proto-Atayal, and also addresses Li's reconstruction of two segments in Proto-Atayalic: word-final \*-d (@sec:li-proto-atayalic-d) and \*g' (@sec:li-proto-atayalic-g). My reconstruction of Proto-Atayal is mostly compatible with Li's Proto-Atayalic, and where it is not, I address the differences in the text. Readers should be careful to distinguish Proto-Atayal and Proto-Atayalic in the remainder of this section.

Proto-Atayalic (PAic) to Proto-Atayal (PA) sound correspondences are seen in @tbl:paic-reflexes-proto-atayal. The differences in regular sound correspondences are minimal, the only two sounds that are different are PAic \*d and \*r, corresponding to PA \*r and \*ɹ, respectively.

| ə      | ə      | PAic \*masəpat 'eight' > PA \*masəpat              |

There are thus only two regular sound changes from Proto-Atayalic to Proto-Atayal. These are:

1. PAic \*r > PA \*ɹ
2. PAic \*d > PA \*r

The sound change (1) necessarily occurred before (2) in order to avoid a merger of the reflexes of Proto-Atayalic \*d and \*r in Proto-Atayal. Both sound changes occurred unconditionally, i.e. in all environments.

@li1981 also discusses two correspondences that I have not yet mentioned. These are (1) Li's reconstruction of word-final \*-d, discussed in @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d, and (2) Li's reconstruction of \*g', both in word-final position and word-medially, discussed in @sec:li-proto-atayalic-g. In the following sections I will provide arguments for why there is no evidence for either of these two protophonemes in Atayal, and that they should not be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal, or even Proto-Atayalic.

### Li's Proto-Atayalic \*-d {#sec:li-proto-atayalic-d}

Li [-@li1981, p. 254] made note of a correspondence where /ʔ/ in some Atayal dialects (Matu'uwal, Squliq, Skikun) corresponds to /t/ in others (Plngawan, S'uli, Klesan, Matu'aw), and to \<c\> [t͡s] in Seediq. This occurs only word-finally. @tbl:gs-t-correspondence shows some examples of this correspondence, of which Li discusses the first four ('feathers', 'leopard', 'ashes', and 'mouse').

The Seediq cognates of the words in Li's list all have final \<c\> [t͡s], for example in the Toda dialect: *palic* 'wing', *qolic* 'mouse', *rəkəlic* 'leopard', and *qəbulic* 'ashes'. However, there is no phonemic distinction between word-final \<c\> /t͡s/ and /t/ in Seediq [@tsukida2005, p. 292;@sung2018, p. 20], and /t/ is affricated word-finally, just like with some Atayal speakers.

Li [-@li1981, p. 255] further suggests that the correspondence should be reconstructed as \*-d in Proto-Atayalic, and supports this claim with the PAn form \*paNid 'wing'. This is problematic, because the Seediq dialects all have the same reflex, whereas Atayal dialects can have either /t/ or /ʔ/ in this correspondence, which would logically require \*-d to also occur in Proto-Atayal. However, **there is no evidence for a \*d phoneme in Proto-Atayal**, since Proto-Atayalic \*d changed to Proto-Atayal \*r: Proto-Atayalic \*dawriq > Proto-Atayal \*rawɹiq 'eyes'.

Careful readers may have noticed that the correspondences in @tbl:gs-t-correspondence occur in a very specific environment, and not just word-finally. With a few exceptions, they are only found in the final syllable *-lit*/*-liʔ*.^[Skikun *kwaniʔ* 'eagle' is likely a sporadic change. Matu'uwal *ʔaŋriʔ* 'housefly', as well as the unexpected correspondences in 'mouse' and 'to flow' are addressed further in the text.] We can hardly expect a phoneme to occur only in such a specific environment. A more likely scenario is a sound change that occurred with existing phonemes in a specific environment.

Another counter-argument to Li's reconstruction of PAic \*d is the behaviour of verbs with this correspondence when suffixed. At least two verbs 'to flow' and 'to peel' can be found with this correspondence, and they both have \<c\> /t͡s/ in Plngawan when suffixed, as seen in @tbl:gs-t-correspondence-verbs.

: /ʔ/ to /t/ correspondence in verbs {#tbl:gs-t-correspondence-verbs}

| Matu'uwal     | Plngawan    | Squliq       | Klesan     | Gloss          |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| **mə**qaluwit | **m**ulit   | **mə**qəlwiʔ | **mə**lyut | 'to flow (AV)' |
| qalwic**un**  | ʔulic**un** | qəlyuʔ**un** | lyut**un** | 'to flow (PV)' |
| q**um**aliʔ   | ʔ**um**alit |              |            | 'to peel (AV)' |
| qaliʔ**un**   | ʔalic**un** |              |            | 'to peel (PV)' |

Moreover, the verb 'to peel' has a corresponding PAn form \*qaNiC, which has a final \*C, normally reflected as \*c in Proto-Atayal, and as \*t word-finally (see @sec:pan-to-proto-atayal for sound correspondences between PAn and Proto-Atayal). Other verbs with root-final \*C in PAn do not have the change to /ʔ/ in Squliq, Skikun, or Matu'uwal: PAn \*kaRaC 'to bite' > (Proto-Atayal \*k**um**at\~kac**un**) > Matu'uwal *k**um**at\~kac**un***, Squliq and Skikun *k**əm**at\~kat**un***. This demonstrates that the correspondence of /t/ to /ʔ/ is not due to regular reflexes of a specific protophoneme that only occurs in this position, but is rather environmentally conditioned.

Matu'uwal *q**um**aliʔ\~qaliʔ**un*** 'to peel' was regularized in its suffixed forms, as this correspondence is otherwise limited to word-final position. Likewise, Squliq ***mə**qəlwiʔ\~qəlyuʔ**un*** 'to flow' underwent regularization, and apparently late enough that its PV form does not exhibit vowel coalescence: the form is *qəlyuʔ**un*** instead of the expected \*\*qəlyun. Note that Matu'uwal has a final /t\~c/ in this root. In Matu'uwal, final /ʔ/ to Plngawan /t/ only appears in the syllable *-liʔ*, or in one case, *-riʔ* (discussed below). Squliq extends the environment to include the syllable *-lwiʔ*, as in ***mə**qəlwiʔ* 'to flow' or *təlwiʔ* 'mulberry'.^[The Squliq and Skikun *təlwiʔ* 'mulberry' has cognates in Seediq *tədiyuc*. Klesan *təluy* appears to be a loan from Squliq based on the sound correspondences.]

@tbl:gs-t-correspondence includes the Matu'uwal form *ʔaŋriʔ* 'housefly'.^[Alternatively, 'housefly' can also be *waŋriʔ*, see correspondences of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ in @sec:consonant-correspondences.] This form appears distinct from the other correspondences in the table for having a final /riʔ/ syllable in Matu'uwal, instead of the expected /liʔ/. Seediq agrees with Matu'uwal here, having *rəŋədi* or *rəŋəji*, depending on the dialect. Crucially, Seediq does not have final \<c\> [t͡s] in this word, but it does have it in all other words in this correspondence set, e.g. Toda Seediq *rəkəlic*, Matu'uwal *ʔakliʔ*, Plngawan *ɹaklit* 'leopard'. This word most likely did not originally belong in this correspondence set, but was later added to it by analogy, and received the derivational suffix *-lit* in Plngawan, Squliq, and Skikun. I explain the derivational aspect of this correspondence at the end of this section.

Another word, 'mouse', has unexpected reflexes in Matu'uwal and Skikun: Matu'uwal *qawlit* and Skikun *qolit* (alongside variant pronunciation *qoliʔ*). Either this word somehow resisted the sound change that occurred everywhere else in the set, or it was reborrowed from another dialect. It is difficult to judge what exactly happened here, although a borrowing scenario appears unlikely, since no other dialects preserved both initial /q/ and final /t/ in this word.

If this is a sound change, what was the phoneme initially? Was it preserved in any of the dialects? Which dialects changed the words in this set, and which ones did not? Here we may once again look to phonotactics and phoneme distribution for answers. Matu'uwal, Squluq, and Skikun do not allow the syllable *-lit* to occur word-finally (with the exception of the aforementioned word 'mouse'). On the other hand, the remaining dialects allow both *-lit* and *-liʔ* to occur in word-final position. @tbl:final-li shows a few instances of word-final *-liʔ* occurring in cognates across the Atayal dialects.

: Final *-liʔ* correspondence across Atayal dialects {#tbl:final-li}

| Matu'uwal | Squliq  | Plngawan | Klesan | Gloss           |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| sumliʔ    | səməliʔ | sunliʔ   | səməli | 'to collect'    |
| buliʔ     | buliʔ   | buliʔ    |        | 'small knife'   |
|           | ʔaliʔ   | ʔaliʔ    | ʔaliʔ  | 'bamboo shoots' |

Since Plngawan, Klesan, S'uli, and Matu'aw distinguish word-final *-liʔ* from *-lit*, while Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun do not, then the former must have preserved the distinction, while the latter merged the two syllables together.

Why this specific syllable? One possibility is that this syllable was a derivational suffix for male register forms (@sec:gender-register presents an overview of the gender register system). We can see the affix in words like Matu'uwal *qabuliʔ* 'ashes' and Squliq *həmaliʔ* 'tongue' when we compare them with PAn forms \*qabu 'ashes' and \*Səma 'tongue' (Matu'uwal has *həmaʔ* 'tongue'). The original Proto-Atayal suffix \*-lit must have been replaced with *-liʔ* in Squliq, Skikun, and Matu'uwal, and this replacement then triggered an analogical change even in words where /lit/ was part of the root, as in Matu'uwal *q**um**aliʔ* 'to peel', cf. Plngawan *ʔ**um**alit*, PAn \*qaNiC.

Thus these words would have originally ended in \*-lit in Proto-Atayal, and were only changed in Squliq, Skikun, and Matu'uwal. This also agrees with the evidence in Seediq, where cognates all have a final \<c\> [t͡s] (< \*-t).

### Li's Proto-Atayalic \*g' {#sec:li-proto-atayalic-g}

Li reconstructs a phoneme \*g' in Proto-Atayalic to account for three sets of correspondences. These are reproduced in @tbl:li-g-prime-correspondences with minor corrections.

: Li's \*g' correspondences [from @li1981, pp. 258-259] {#tbl:li-g-prime-correspondences}

| Skikun    | Matu'uwal      | Inago Seediq | Gloss                    |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| pisaʔ     | (piyaʔ)        | piyaʔ        | 'how many'               |
| kisaʔ     | kisaʔ          | kiyaʔ        | 'soon, later'            |
| bəgisaʔ   | bagisaʔ        | bəgiyaʔ      | 'reed of loom'           |
| cəhisaʔ   | cu hisaʔ       | sigaʔ        | 'yesterday'              |
| kəgis     | kəgiy          | kərig        | 'hemp, ramie'            |
| kəgis-i   | k**um**kagis-i |              | 'to strip hemp (PV.imp)' |
| **m**es   | **ma**baiy     | **m**arig    | 'to buy (AV)'            |
| bes**un** | bays**un**     | bərig**i**   | 'to buy (PV)'            |

The first set Li identified are word-medial correspondences between /s/ in Atayal and \<y\> /j/ in Seediq, specifically between the vowels i\_a (except in the word 'yesterday'). The second are word-medial correspondences of /s/ in Atayal and /g/ in Seediq between other vowels. The third set are word-final correspondences of \<y\> /j/ in Atayal except Skikun, /s/ in Skikun, and /g/ or \<y\> /j/ in Seediq, depending on the dialect.

If we start with word-final correspondences, we see the following pattern: they always occur following the vowel /i/, and all of Li's examples are in verbs with consonantal alternations in Atayal. Here, Li uses Skikun as crucial evidence to reconstruct this protophoneme. However, as explained in @sec:paradigm-leveling, **Skikun has a very strong tendency to level out consonant alternations in verbal paradigms**. Li's correspondences of Proto-Atayalic \*g in final position after \*i are identical to those of \*g', except for the Skikun reflex, but all the correspondences of \*g are found in nominal roots, i.e. roots that do not take suffixes, for example \*bunaqig 'sand'.

In other words, what Li saw as a reflex of a unique protophoneme is in fact an artefact of paradigm leveling in alternating roots in Skikun. When this paradigm leveling in verbal roots is taken into account, Li's \*g and \*g' are in complementary distribution with each other, since \*g' is only ever found after \*i. Reconstructing two phonemes here is superfluous.

For Proto-Atayal, this means that no additional protophonemes need to be proposed in this case, as the correspondences are adequately explained as regular reflexes of \*-s- and \*-g, with later paradigm leveling in Skikun. The alternating consonants in these verbal roots have to be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal.

## Sound correspondences between Proto-Atayal and Proto-Austronesian {#sec:pan-to-proto-atayal}

Out of over 1100 reconstructed Proto-Atayal forms, I have found Proto-Austronesian etyma for only around a tenth of that number. In general, cognacy rates between PAn reconstructions and Atayalic vocabulary are low. Nevertheless, out of more that 100 cognate pairs, regular sound correspondences may be established. They are presented in @tbl:pan-reflexes-proto-atayal, with Proto-Atayalic given for reference. The correspondences between PAn and Proto-Atayalic are largely compatible with Li's [-@li1981] reconstruction, and the differences between Li's reconstruction and my own are addressed in @sec:proto-atayalic-to-proto-atayal.

Note that there are still gaps in the data. For example, I have not been able to identify any cognates with PAn \*g or word-initial \*h, and there is only one instance each of PAn \*r and \*ñ.

As seen in @tbl:pan-reflexes-proto-atayal, some phonemes have different reflexes depending on their position in the word. PAn \*C was reflected as Proto-Atayal \*c except word-finally, where it was reflected as \*t: PAn \*kaRaC 'to bite' > Proto-Atayal \*k**um**at, but \*kac**un** when suffixed. This is due to a restriction in Proto-Atayal phonotactics, where \*c was not allowed word-finally, and it was merged with \*t in that position, see also @sec:proto-atayal-phonotactics.

Proto-Austronesian \*ə is reflected in Proto-Atayal as \*u in the final syllable and as \*ə elsewhere: PAn \*buhət 'squirrel' > Proto-Atayal \*bəhut (with vowel metathesis), PAn \*dakəS 'camphor tree' > Proto-Atayal \*rakus, PAn \*qaSəlu 'pestle' > Proto-Atayal \*qasəɹuʔ, as well as in the Patient Voice suffix PAn \*-ən > Proto-Atayal \*-un. In verbal roots, the vowel alternates after suffixation: PAn \*taNək 'to cook' > Proto-Atayal \*t**um**aluk (AV), but \*talək**un** (PV).

Proto-Austronesian \*s is regularly reflected as Proto-Atayal \*x word-finally and as \*h elsewhere, with many examples. The following etyma are clearly related, but are exceptions: PAn \*Ciŋas 'food debris' > Proto-Atayal \*ciŋas, and the Formosan etymon \*lapis 'flying squirrel' > Proto-Atayal \*ɹapit. The irregular correspondences might be explained by borrowing early in the language's history.

Proto-Austronesian \*S has the regular reflex \*s in Proto-Atayal, but may also be reflected as \*h in word-initial position. @tbl:pan-s-reflexes lists all occurrences of PAn word-initial \*S in my cognate sets. The affixes in 'four', 'Grey-cheeked fulvetta', 'waist', and 'snow' are derivational affixes used in the gender register system, see @sec:gender-register for details.

| \text{*}SuRəNa     | \*hula-qig    | 'snow, ice'             |

Here the amount of words reflecting \*s and \*h in Proto-Atayal is roughly the same. They do not appear to have any conditioning environment, and words in both groups belong in the basic vocabulary. This is a mystery that should be addressed in future research.

There is a small number of PAn etyma with \*j that have reflexes in Proto-Atayal. However, the reflexes are not systematic, as can be seen in @tbl:pan-j-reflexes.

: Reflexes of Proto-Austronesian \*j in Proto-Atayal {#tbl:pan-j-reflexes}

| PAn           | Proto-Atayal  | Gloss             |

| \text{*}bajaq | \*baq         | 'to know'         |

| \text{*}pijax | \*pisaʔ       | 'how many'        |

In most cases, \*j is simply deleted (the glottal stop in \*s**um**aʔuk 'to smell' and \*suwaʔiʔ 'younger sibling' was likely epenthetic), but in \*pagay 'rice plant' and \*pugaʔ 'navel' it is reflected as \*g instead. The Atayal traditionally planted millet and not rice, so \*pagay 'rice plant' can be argued to be a borrowing.

The \*s in \*pisaʔ 'how many' is most likely related to the environment: following \*i and preceding a stressed vowel.^[Rhotacism in Squliq and Plngawan occurred in an identical environment.] The irregular correspondence in PAn \*siRa 'yesterday' > Proto-Atayal \*hisaʔ is likely related, although with only two etyma it is difficult to make conclusions. None of the 1100+ Proto-Atayal etyma in my database have the sequence \*-iga-, which suggests a sound change preceding Proto-Atayal (perhaps from Proto-Atayalic to Proto-Atayal). See also @sec:li-proto-atayalic-g for other correspondences in the same environment.

Proto-Austronesian \*R was regularly reflected as Proto-Atayal \*g. There are some exceptions, listed in @tbl:pan-r-reflexes.

: Reflexes of Proto-Austronesian \*R in Proto-Atayal {#tbl:pan-r-reflexes}

| \text{*}kaRi  | \*kaʔiʔ      | 'language'  |
| \text{*}Rubu  | \*ʔubuʔ      | 'den'       |

The reflex in Proto-Atayal \*hisaʔ 'yesterday' was discussed above. Proto-Atayal \*-buruk 'rotten' is the only case of PAn \*R > Proto-Atayal \*r, and is likely a loan. The rest of the etyma have \*R being deleted in Proto-Atayal. At least some of these correspondences may be attributable to the Atayalic gender register system, described in @sec:gender-register. One of the changes in the male register was deleting word-initial or word-medial \*g in Proto-Atayal, which is the regular reflex of PAn \*R. It is possible that for some of these words only the male register form survived.

## Interim summary {#sec:phono-summary}

This chapter presented the reconstruction of the phonological system of Proto-Atayal based on internal evidence from Atayal dialects, as well as external evidence from Seediq and Proto-Austronesian. Proto-Atayal had a slightly larger consonant inventory than any extant dialect, but a four-vowel system instead of the more complex vowel systems that developed in various dialects later. Its syllable structure was also simpler than most Atayal dialects, with only CV and CVG syllables allowed in non-final position.

This reconstruction allowed me to compare the phonology of Proto-Atayal with those of Proto-Atayalic and Proto-Austronesian, and find regular correspondences between them. I also re-examined the evidence for Li's [-@li1981] reconstuction of the segments \*g' and word-final \*-d in Proto-Atayalic, and found it insufficient in both cases.

Below is a summary of common phonological innovations in Atayal dialects. Sound changes that are shared by at least two dialects are as follows:

1. **Merger of \*-lit and \*-liʔ.** A very specific sound change that occurred in Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun. This sound change left all three with no words ending with the syllable *-lit*, except Matu'uwal *qawlit* and Skikun *qolit* 'mouse, rat', which was irregularly preserved in both dialects.
2. **Merger of \*ɹ and \*y > y.** This sound change happened in all Atayal dialects except Plngawan and Matu'uwal. The merger was complete and unconditional, happening in all environments.
3. **Merger of \*q and \*ʔ > ʔ.** This merger occurred in Matu'aw, S'uli, Klesan, and Plngawan. Glottal stops that come from historical \*q block vowel coalescence, which means that vowel coalescence preceded this merger.
4. **Merger of \*c and \*s > s.** These two protophonemes merged in Squliq, S'uli, and Matu'aw. In Squliq, the merger occurred after affrication of \*t, since these new affricate allophones were not affected.
5. **Liquid assimilation.** Proto-Atayal \*r in the onset was assimilated to /l/ if followed by \*l in the onset of another syllable. Codas did not trigger this change, which can be seen in Skikun, Squliq, S'uli, and Klesan.
6. **Affrication of \*t.** Regular affrication of \*t occurred in Squliq and Skikun. There are lexical items in Klesan and S'uli that appear to be affected by the same rule, but it is not universal in the lexicon of either dialect, and is hence influence from Squliq due to language contact, not an internal sound change. Affrication of \*t in Squliq occurred before \<y\> /j/ as well as before /i/, while in Skikun only the vowel /i/ triggered this change.
7. **Rhotacism.** This sound change can be found in Squliq and Plngawan. Its environment is quite specific: Proto-Atayal \*s became /r/ when preceded by /i/ and followed by a stressed vowel, or \*s > r /i\_V́. The environment is identical in both dialects.
8. **Loss of final \*-g.** Proto-Atayal final \*g was lost in a very similar fashion in most Atayal dialects. No dialect preserves final \*g before \*i, although Matu'aw did have it until recently, as recorded by Paul Li [-@li1980;-@li1981]. Following /a/ and /u/, it is still preserved in Matu'uwal, and in Skikun it merges with /x/. In other dialects, Proto-Atayal word-final \*g became /w/ after /a/, and was lost after /u/ and /i/, lengthening the preceding vowel. Since final /g/ could still be found in Matu'aw circa 1980, we can be sure it does not share this sound change with other dialects.
9. **Final labial to velar merger.** Plngawan and Klesan disallow labial consonants in word-final position. All labials become velars instead, and resurface as labials if the root is suffixed.
10. **Final \*-b devoicing.** Proto-Atayal final \*b was preserved only in Matu'uwal. All other dialects devoiced it to /p/ (which in Plngawan and Klesan becomes /k/ due to rule 9). It can surface as /b/ when the root is suffixed, though in some cases it is regularized to /p/ due to paradigm leveling (see @sec:paradigm-leveling).
11. **Prepenultimate vowel lenition.** This sound change occurred in Skikun, Squliq, S'uli, and Klesan. All vowels preceding the penultimate syllable were weakened, usually to schwa, leading to the loss of vowel distinctions beyond the rightmost foot.

These sound changes are presented in @tbl:common-sound-changes. If a sound change occurred in a given dialect, it is checkmarked.^[Abbreviations are as follows: Ml = Matu'uwal, Sk = Skikun, Sq = Squliq, S' = S'uli, Mw = Matu'aw, Kl = Klesan, Pl = Plngawan.]

It is clear from the table that **there is no subgrouping in which at least one sound change does not occur independently several times.** No matter how we try to subgroup them, some sound changes will happen separately in different dialects. This is the first hurdle in using phonological evidence to subgroup Atayal dialects.

Many of these sound changes are also common (and thus it isn't surprising that they would occur several times). A number can be found in some Seediq dialects, as well as other Austronesian languages in Taiwan as well as outside it.

The only two sound changes that are specific are the merger of \*-lit and \*-liʔ, and rhotacism. Rhotacism in itself is not uncommon [@romero2003], but the environtment where it occurs is highly specific, and this environment is identical in Squliq and Plngawan. The merger of \*-lit and \*-liʔ can also be described as a merger of word-final \*t and \*ʔ in an **extremely** specific environment. Unfortunately, these two sound changes occur in two different groups of dialects, and only Squliq has both. This means that one of these changes must have occurred twice, and was not a shared innovation.

The evidence from sound changes alone is insufficient for subgrouping. Additional evidence is needed to let us decide which of the sound changes mentioned above are shared innovations, especially the two specific sound changes. We get this evidence from shared innovations and aberrations in the lexicon, described in Chapter 6.

# Proto-Atayal morphology and lexicon {#sec:morphology-lexicon}

This chapter discusses the reconstruction of Proto-Atayal morphology and vocabulary, using both internal and external evidence. The reconstruction of the Austronesian voice system in Proto-Atayal verbs is presented in @sec:voice-system. @sec:gender-register talks about the gender register system in Proto-Atayal, its derivational strategies, its history, and how it can be helpful in subgrouping. @sec:lexical-innovations presents the shared lexical innovations in Atayal dialects, divided into two major groups, with further subdivisions in each one. @sec:paradigm-leveling introduces verbal paradigm leveling in various Atayal dialects. Lexical borrowings between Atayal dialects and from Seediq are discussed in @sec:interdialectal-borrowings, with Klesan and Plngawan as the most prominent examples of lexical borrowing. And finally, @sec:external-evidence-lexical explains the use of external evidence for reconstructing the Proto-Atayal vocabulary, using both Seediq cognates and Proto-Austronesian reconstructions.

I do not discuss the pronoun system or nominal case markers in this dissertation, due to both insufficient data at hand and time constraints. From my current data it is clear that they do not provide additional evidence for subgrouping in Atayal, and omitting them will not change the final result. Both of these phenomena are worth looking into in future research.

## Voice system morphology in Proto-Atayal {#sec:voice-system}

Atayal, like most Formosan languages, has what's been variously called the 'Philippine-type aligment', 'Austronesian-type alignment', or 'focus system'. In an Austronesian context, the terms 'focus' and 'voice' mean the same thing and are used interchangeably [@blust2013, p. 437]. In this dissertation, I only use the term 'voice'.

For morphosyntactic phenomena related to the voice system in Austronesian languages in general, the reader is referred to Blust [-@blust2013, sec. 7.1]. The voice system in Matu'uwal Atayal is described from a syntactic and semantic perspective in @huang2001.

The voice system in Atayal belongs to the 'Philippine-type' of voice morphology in Austronesian languages [@pawley1979]. It has four distinct voices: the Actor/Agent Voice (AV), the Patient/Undergoer Voice (PV), the Locative Voice (LV), and the Instrumental/Benefactive Voice (IV/BV). Each of these four voices has its own verbal morphology and semantics. PV, LV, and IV share certain morphosyntactic properties and are often grouped together under the term non-Actor Voice, or NAV [@tsuchida1975, p. 43].^[Tsuchida actually uses the term 'non-actor focus' (NAF), but the important part here is the grouping of AV vs NAV, rather than nomenclature.] In NAV clauses, the agent is marked with the genitive case, while in AV clauses it receives nominative case marking instead.

Below I provide examples of affixation in the indicative and the subjunctive moods. The 'subjunctive' in Atayal is not limited to subordinate clauses, and is used as a cover term for the affixation that appears in negative and imperative constructions. Huang [-@huang2000;-@huang2001] puts both negative and imperative constructions under 'irrealis', but that also includes another mood with its own morphology: the optative (or 'projective' in Huang's terminology).^[I do not include optative affixation due to lack of data for some dialects. I expect the optative affixes in Proto-Atayal to be \*-aw for PV, \*-ay for LV, and \*-anay for IV based on the data at hand and PAn morphology [@ross2009, p. 296].]

The Actor Voice places emphasis on the performer of the action, or the bearer of a trait in more adjective-like predicates. Actor Voice sentences were found to be intransitive in Squliq by Liao [-@liao2004, p. 358], and intransitive in both Squliq and Matu'uwal Atayal by @chang2004. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, AV in other Atayal dialects is assumed to be intransitive as well. AV in the indicative mood can be marked with the prefix *ma-* (or *mə-* in dialects with prepenult vowel weakening), the infix *-um-* (or *-əm-*), or be completely unmarked, for example in Proto-Atayal \*baq 'to know' and its reflexes. Examples of AV affixation on a single root and their reconstructions are shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-av.

: AV affixation in Proto-Atayal {#tbl:proto-atayal-av}

| Proto-Atayal        | Matu'uwal  | Plngawan      | Skikun      | Matu'aw     | Gloss                   |
|---------------------|------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| \text{*}k**um**aɹal | k**um**aal | k**um**aɹal   | k**əm**ayal | k**um**ayal | 'to say, to speak (AV)' |
| \text{*}**ma**kaɹal | **ma**kaal | **ma**kakaɹal | **mə**kayal | **ma**kayal | 'to discuss (AV)'       |
| \text{*}kaɹal       | kaal       | kaɹal         | kayal       | kayal       | 'to say (AV.SBJV)'      |

The two AV indicative affixes \*ma- and \*-um- are distinct. Huang [-@huang2001, pp. 58-59] analyzes their reflexes in Matu'uwal as 'dynamic' (for *-um-*) versus 'static' (for *ma-*). They can appear on the same root, where the difference is usually in valency: Proto-Atayal \**ma*culiŋ 'to be burning' vs \*c**um**uliŋ 'to burn s.t.', or \**ma*kəɹay 'dry' vs \*k**um**əɹay 'to dry s.t.'. The former is monovalent or monadic, meaning it does not have a specific agent, while the latter is bivalent or dyadic, meaning the agent is specified, and is the subject of the verb. Alternatively, \*ma- could also signify reciprocity: Proto-Atayal \*k**um**aɹal 'to say, to speak' vs \***ma**kaɹal 'to discuss, to talk with each other'.

The infix \*-um- would sometimes surface as \*m-, replacing the first consonant of the root. This happened most often in roots starting with labial consonants: Proto-Atayal \***m**umuɹaʔ 'to plant (AV)' vs \*pumuɹaʔ*un* 'to plant (PV)', or \***m**əhul 'to tie (AV)' vs \*bəhəl**an** 'to tie (LV)'. In the AV form of these verbs, the initial \*p or \*b is replaced with \*m in lieu of affixation, a process that Blust [-@blust2004, pp. 76-80;-@blust2013, p. 244] calls 'pseudo nasal substitution'. We know this initial \*m- corresponds to \*-um- and not \*ma- because the former cannot appear together with labials, but the latter can: Proto-Atayal \***ma**bahuq 'to wash clothes (AV)', or \***ma**paŋaʔ 'to carry on back (AV)'. This process of 'pseudo nasal substitution' also appears on some specific verbs that do not start with a labial, e.g. Proto-Atayal \***m**aniq 'to eat (AV)', but \*kaniq 'to eat (AV.SBJV)'.

The Patient Voice places emphasis on the undergoer of the action. Semantically speaking, it carries the notion of telicity, or a fully completed action. In Squliq Atayal, it denotes future events, but not in Matu'uwal [@huang1995, p. 45]. PV in the indicative mood is marked with the suffix *-un* in all Atayal dialects, and with *-i* in the subjunctive, as shown in @tbl:proto-atayal-pv. Note that this subjunctive *-i* suffix does not have a coda, and the vowel receives compensatory lengthening.

: PV affixation in Proto-Atayal {#tbl:proto-atayal-pv}

| Proto-Atayal      | Matu'uwal | Plngawan  | Skikun    | Klesan    | Gloss              |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------|
| \text{*}niq**un** | niq**un** | niʔ**un** | niq**un** | niʔ**un** | 'to eat (PV)'      |
| \text{*}niq**i**  | niq**i**  | niʔ**i**  | niq**i**  | niʔ**i**  | 'to eat (PV.SBJV)' |

The Locative Voice places emphasis on the actant that is partially affected (contrasted with PV, where the undergoer is fully affected). This voice can be used with locations of actions, hence the name. It is also used with verbs of perception, such as seeing or hearing. In Squliq, LV is often used for past events, however this is not the case with Matu'uwal [@huang1995, p. 45]. It is marked in the indicative mood with the suffix *-an* in all Atayal dialects, and in the subjunctive mood with the suffix *-i* (identical to PV subjunctive), as seen in @tbl:proto-atayal-lv.

| \text{*}puŋ**i**  | puŋ**i**  | puŋ**i**  | puŋ**i**  | puŋ**i**  | 'to hear (LV.SBJV)' |

The Instrumental/Benefactive Voice^[IV/BV is also called Referential Focus (RF) or Circumstantial Focus (CF) in some publications.] in its broadest sense encodes a transported theme, i.e. an object that is transported from one place to another, whether physically or metaphorically [@huang2005, p. 792;@chang2011, p. 806]. It is often used for an instrument of an action, or a benefactor, which is where the names IV and BV come from. It is marked in the indicative mood with the prefix *si-* (or *sə-* in dialects with prepenult vowel weakening), and in the subjunctive with the suffix *-ani* (open final syllable), as demonstrated in @tbl:proto-atayal-iv.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The full system in the indicative as well as the subjunctive is presented in @tbl:voice-affixes-proto-atayal. Note that the terms 'subjunctive' or 'irrealis' are commonly used with the focus system of Atayal and Austronesian languages in general.

: Voice affixes in Proto-Atayal {#tbl:voice-affixes-proto-atayal}

|       | Indicative   | Subjunctive |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| AV    | \*ma-/\*-um- | ∅           |
| PV    | \*-un        | \*-i        |
| LV    | \*-an        | \*-i        |
| IV/BV | \*si-        | \*-ani      |

The voice system morphology is largely identical across Atayal dialects, and there are no issues with its reconstruction to Proto-Atayal. The only difference is vowel reduction in the prefixes \*ma- and \*si- as well as the infix \*-um- in four Atayal dialects. Squliq, Skikun, S'uli, and Klesan (dialects which have prepenultimate vowel reduction) have *mə-*, *sə-*, and *-əm-* instead, respectively. In these four dialects, the aforementioned affixes always have a reduced vowel /ə/, even when it falls on the penultimate syllable and would not be reduced under normal vowel lenition rules: Proto-Atayal \*k*um*at 'to bite (AV)' > Squliq, Skikun, S'uli, Klesan *k**əm**at*.

The subjunctive suffixes *-i* and *-ani* are vowel-final, and the final vowel /i/ is phonetically lengthened. The same lengthening can be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal. The AV infix \*-um- is left-anchored, inserted between the first consonant and the first vowel of a root.

## Gender register system in Proto-Atayal and its descendants {#sec:gender-register}

Atayal has gained attention in linguistic literature due to the gender register system in its lexicon. Matu'uwal preserves the system to the fullest extent, and it has collapsed in other dialects except for some occasional remnants [@li1980a;@li1982a;@li1983], although even in Matu'uwal, only a handful of elderly speakers are even aware of this distinction, let alone able to use it correctly. In accordance with this system, men and women would use different roots for the same word, for example the verb 'to weave' in Matu'uwal is *t**um**inun* in the female register and *t**um**inuq* in the male register. This system should not be confused with grammatical gender as found in, for example, many European languages; grammatical gender is a type of noun class system, but there are no noun classes in Atayal. Unlike grammatical gender on nouns, the Atayal gender register distinction can be found in all types of content words, both nominal and verbal roots, but not every root necessarily has this distinction.

The female register corresponds to Proto-Austronesian cognates in Atayal: PAn \*taNək 'to cook' > Matu'uwal *t**um**aluk* (f), cf. *t**um**ahuk* (m); or PAn \*kuCu 'head louse' > Matu'uwal *kucuʔ* (f), cf. *kuhiŋ* (m).^[Here and following, '(m)' stands for 'male register' and '(f)' for 'female register'.] The female register is thus the set of inherited roots from which male register roots were later derived.

The gender register system used various processes to derive male register words from female register ones. As seen in @tbl:ml-gender-register, these include suffixes (that can replace the final segment of the final syllable), right-anchored infixes, segment deletion, segment substitution, and in a few rare cases, suppletion. @li1983 provides a comprehensive overview of all derivation strategies with many examples. Li also notes that the choice of derivation strategy is **not predictable**, but instead lexically determined.

: Examples of male register derivation strategies in Matu'uwal {#tbl:ml-gender-register}

| Female register | Male register | Gloss                 |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| hapuy           | hapuniq       | 'fire'                |
| kucuʔ           | kuhing        | 'head louse'          |
| guquh           | guqiluh       | 'banana'              |
| q**um**asug     | q**um**asuwag | 'to divide, to share' |
| ragum           | raum          | 'needle'              |
| **man**caqrug   | **man**caʔrux | 'to stand'            |
| ʔibubuh         | bawwak        | 'pig'                 |

Other dialects have lost this distinction, and normally use just one word out of a register pair. Occasionally, both forms are preserved, sometimes with a semantic distinction, and sometimes with the same meaning: Plngawan ***pa**hpuy* or ***pa**hpuniʔ* 'to cook grains', cf. Matu'uwal *hapuy* 'fire (f)' (< PAn \*Sapuy) and *hapuniq* 'fire (m)'; Squliq *qəhuniq* 'tree' and *qahuy* 'firewood', cf. Matu'uwal *kahuniq* 'tree (m)' and *kahuy* 'tree (f)' (< PAn \*kaSiw).

The gender register system can be reconstructed to Proto-Atayalic, since traces of male register suffixes can be found in Seediq, e.g. Seediq *qəbulic* 'ash', cf. Proto-Atayal \*qabulit, PAn \*qabu. Both Seediq and Atayal have a suffix in this word, so Proto-Atayalic \*qabulit 'ash' can be reconstructed. Likewise for Proto-Atayal \*kuhiŋ and Seediq *quhiŋ* 'head louse', which are derived male register forms of Proto-Atayal \*kucuʔ, cf. Matu'uwal *kucuʔ* 'head louse (f)' < PAn \*kuCu.

The traces of the register system in Seediq are relatively few in number, though undoubtedly already present, as demonstrated above. The system was developed further after the split of Atayal and Seediq, as evidenced by the much larger number of derived lexemes in Atayal.

One very important detail to note is that **the Atayal gender register system was not static.** Instead, it continued to be productive after the split of Proto-Atayal. We can tell this is the case for two reasons: first, there may be more than one male register form across dialects for a single etymon; and second, loanwords were also affected.

A number of etyma have two male register reflexes in diffent dialects, some of which are shown in @tbl:diff-male-reg.^[Abbreviations in this and the following table are: Ml = Matu'uwal, S' = S'uli, Sk = Skikun, Pl = Plngawan, Mw = Matu'aw, Kl = Klesan.] The first column shows reconstructed items from the female register (including two that do not have direct reflexes, more on that below), while the second and third columns display derived male register forms and the dialect in which they occur.

: Different male register forms in different dialects {#tbl:diff-male-reg}

| (\text{*}buɹal)         | buɹatiŋ (Pl)      | byaliŋ (Sk)        | 'moon'         |

[^V]: A capital V in reconstructed words stands for a vowel segment whose phonetic value is uncertain.

The items in the first column are identified as female register using at least one of the following two criteria: (1) they are reflexes of PAn etyma, (2) they are found in Matu'uwal as female register forms with a corresponding male register form. All except \*\*raqis 'face' and \*\*buɹal 'moon' have reflexes in at least one dialect.^[Double asterisks stand for expected, but unattested forms.]

The same root may use different derivation strategies in different dialects. For example, Proto-Atayal female register \*hagaʔ 'stone wall' corresponds to Plngawan *haʔ*, with deletion of /g/ followed by vowel coalescence, and to S'uli *həgayuŋ*, which uses suffixation instead. This confirms Li's [-@li1983] conclusion that the choice of derivation cannot be predicted phonologically.

In parallel with different derivation strategies for the same root, the gender register distinction may give rise to suppletive forms in verbal paradigms. For example the Klesan verb *s**əm**əwaʔiŋ* 'to promise (AV)' has the male register suffix *-ʔiŋ*, as can be seen in @tbl:diff-male-reg, but its LV form is *swal**an*** 'to promise (LV)', which is a reflex of the female register stem, reconstructed in Proto-Atayal as \*sVwal.

The forms \*raqis 'face' and \*buɹal 'moon' do not have direct reflexes in any dialect, however both have corresponding PAn etyma: PAn \*daqiS 'face' and \*bulaN 'moon'. Additionally, there is the Matu'uwal verb *turaqis* 'to wash one's face', which appears to have been derived from the unattested \*raqis plus the prefix *tu-*. See also @tbl:fem-register-derived-verbs and surrounding discussion for more on derived verbs and the gender register system.

A few etyma have as many as three different male register forms across dialects, an attestation of the productive nature of the gender register system even after the breakup of Proto-Atayal. The words in @tbl:three-male-reg are presented in five columns, with Proto-Atayal etyma in the leftmost column. The Proto-Atayal forms were reconstructed based on female register forms in Matu'uwal, checked against the most common denominator in derived male register forms. The following three columns present various derived forms, including the male register in Matu'uwal and related forms in Plngawan.

: Etyma with three different male register forms across dialects {#tbl:three-male-reg}

| Proto-Atayal        | Matu'uwal (f) | Matu'uwal (m) | Plngawan   | Other            | Gloss     |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------------|-----------|
| \text{*}g**um**əbul | g**um**bul    | g**um**uuq    | ʔ**um**bul | g**əm**əʔul (Sk) | 'to bury' |
| \text{*}giqas       | giqas         | ʔiqas         | gaʔaɹus    | gaʔanus (Mw)     | 'new'     |
| \text{*}gVlahaŋ     | gilahaŋ       | ʔilahaŋ       | ɹahalaŋ    | gəlabaŋ  (Sk)    | 'wide'    |

Here we see segment replacement and infixation being used in various ways. In 'to bury', Plngawan replaced the initial segment \*g, whereas Skikun replaced the medial consonant \*b. In 'new', Matu'uwal uses initial consonant deletion/substitution, while Plngawan and Matu'aw use infixes, though different ones. In 'wide', both Plngawan replaced the initial consonant \*g with /ɹ/ while Matu'uwal deleted it. Initial /ʔ/ in Matu'uwal may come from historical \*ɹ, but we would expect reflexes to appear in other dialects, which they do not. Skikun and Squliq *gəlabaŋ*, Matu'aw *galahaŋ*, and even Seediq *gəlahaŋ* all point to initial \*g in Proto-Atayal, so the Plngawan and Matu'uwal male register forms are more likely independent developments (note also consonant metathesis in Plngawan *ɹahalaŋ*).

There are instances of male register forms being derived for loanwords and lexical innovations. The Proto-Atayal etymon for 'clothes' was \*lukus, reflected in all dialects except Matu'uwal.^[Matu'aw and S'uli innovated a different word for clothes: Matu'aw *balatan*, S'uli *latan*. However, the derived verb ***ma**lukus* 'to wear clothes' can still be found in these dialects, unlike Matu'uwal.] Matu'uwal instead borrowed the word *siyatuʔ* from Pazih *siatu* 'clothes', and innovated the male register form *situwiŋ* 'clothes (m)'. Unique lexical innovations in Matu'uwal may have male register forms, for example ***ma**qaylup* 'to sleep (f)' and ***mə**qilaap* 'to sleep (m)', or *ʔibluŋ* 'rice husk, chaff (f)' and *ʔibhuŋ* 'rice husk, chaff (m)'.

In some cases, the female register form of a noun disappeared from some or all dialects, but the root was retained in derived verbs. @tbl:fem-register-derived-verbs presents some examples of this phenomenon. The reconstructed or expected Proto-Atayal female register forms are in the first column. The second column shows the derived verbal forms without corresponding nouns in the dialect. The third column contains the male register forms of the same etyma in that dialect.

: Female register forms being preserved in derived verbs {#tbl:fem-register-derived-verbs}

| Female register | Derived verb     | Male register | Gloss          |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| \text{*}buŋaʔ   | **tə**buŋaʔ (Kl) | ŋahiʔ         | 'sweet potato' |
| \text{*}hapuy   | **pə**hapuy (Sq) | puniq         | 'fire'         |
| (\text{*}haŋal) | **ma**haŋal (Ml) | haŋaliq       | 'shoulder'     |
| (\text{*}raqis) | **tu**raqis (Ml) | raqinas       | 'face'         |

The Proto-Atayal nouns \*buŋaʔ 'sweet potato' and \*hapuy 'fire' can be reconstructed based on female register reflexes in Matu'uwal, which are *buŋaʔ* and *hapuy*, respectively. Neither of these can be found in any other dialect, but the roots do appear in related verbs, such as Klesan ***tə**buŋaʔ* 'to plant sweet potatoes' and Squliq ***pə**hapuy* 'to cook grains'.

Reflexes of the female register forms \*haŋal 'shoulder' and \*raqis 'face' are not attested in any dialect, but related verbs can be found. Matu'uwal (among other dialects) has ***ma**haŋal* 'to carry on shoulder' and *turaqis* 'to wash one's face', which must have been derived from the aforementioned female register nouns. There is additional external evidence from PAn \*daqiS 'face' which lends more weight to \*raqis as the original form.

When reconstructing Proto-Atayal etyma, the gender register system needs to be accounted for. Because it continued being productive after the split of Proto-Atayal, not all male register forms can be reconstructed to that level. Instead, innovations in the gender register system, be it lexical items of even new derivation strategies, can be used for subgrouping. Additional external evidence can also help with reconstructions. Seediq may show that some etyma were affixed even in Proto-Atayalic, as is the case with \*qabulit 'ash'. Proto-Austronesian etyma can be helpful in determining female register forms where there are no direct reflexes, for examle PAn \*daqiS 'face' > Proto-Atayal \*raqis.

## Lexical innovations and shared aberrations {#sec:lexical-innovations}

This section lists lexical items exclusively shared between several dialects. These uniquely shared words fall largely across two groups, one being S'uli, Plngawan, Klesan, and Matu'aw (@sec:shared-innovations-pl-su-mw-cu), and the other being Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun (@sec:shared-innovations-ml-sq-sk). Three additional sets, each one within a larger group, were also identified: (1) S'uli, Matu'aw, and Klesan (@sec:shared-innovations-su-kl); (2) S'uli and Matu'aw (@sec:shared-innovations-su-mw); and (3) Squliq and Skikun (@sec:shared-innovations-sq-sk). Other apparently shared lexical items can be explained as borrowings, mostly from the majority Squliq dialect into neighbouring dialects. Lexical borrowings are discussed in @sec:interdialectal-borrowings.

The data in this section is presented with a caveat. Some lexical items presented as uniquely shared between a group of dialects may turn out to occur outside that group as well. During my fieldwork, I would generally try to elicit an expected reflex of a protoform if one was not given to me by the speakers, so these are not simple omissions in my data. However there may be other reasons for lacking a lexical item that turns out to exist, such as a speaker forgetting an uncommon word. Nevertheless, even with this caveat there is still a clear enough tendency in the data to group the dialects into two sets, as is done below.

If the aforementioned two groups have different etyma for the same meaning, it is not always apparent which word was innovated and which was inherited (if any). In these cases it may be useful to turn to external evidence (@sec:external-evidence-lexical), although it does not always provide an answer. In cases where a Proto-Atayal form cannot be determined through either internal or external evidence, uniquely shared words from both groups are listed.

### Shared innovations between Plngawan, S'uli, Matu'aw, and Klesan {#sec:shared-innovations-pl-su-mw-cu}

These four dialects share a number of lexical items that are not found outside the group. S'uli and Matu'aw in particular use largely the same etyma. This tendency is quite strong even with the limited amount of data for these two dialects in my wordlist. In this section, I mostly use S'uli as a stand-in for both itself and Matu'aw, unless a particular S'uli word is missing in my dataset (or replaced) but a Matu'aw cognate is present.

Excepting the S'uli-Matu'aw pair, these dialects are geographically distant from each other, and there is no evidence of contact between them. They are spread out with S'uli and Matu'aw in the western part of the Atayal-speaking regioun, Plngawan in the south, and Klesan in the east. Sound correspondences between lexical items in this section are regular unless noted otherwise.

@tbl:shared-innovations-pl-rest presents examples of Plngawan lexical items that are shared with S'uli-Matu'aw, Klesan, or both. Matu'aw forms are used instead of S'uli in several cases, either because I do not have a S'uli form in my wordlist, or because S'uli has a loan instead of the expected reflex. In two cases neither a S'uli nor a Matu'aw form was found in my database, these were left blank. Squliq forms are given for comparison, but the forms in the table do not have cognates in Matu'uwal or Skikun unless otherwise noted.

<!-- fixme: insert vertical line next to sq? -->

The Klesan words *ləlaw* 'right hand side', *pəhəpah* 'flower, and *tunux* 'stone' are the same etyma as in Squliq, and may have been borrowed. We have no diagnostic for these words, but Klesan has many verifiable borrowings from Squliq, see @sec:borrowings-cu for more information. S'uli has *ləlaw* 'right hand side' and *gahap* 'seed' that are also shared with Squliq (however Matu'aw has *analiʔ* 'right hand side', which is cognate with the Plngawan form).

The word for 'chin' across Atayal dialects is complicated. S'uli actually has two forms, *ʔaŋi* and *ʔabay*, the latter cognate with Squliq and Skikun *qabay*, and the former with Matu'uwal *qaŋiʔ* and Matu'aw *ʔaŋiʔ*. Plngawan *ʔabalit* and Klesan *bəlit* appear to be male register forms derived from a form like \*qabay using the suffix *-lit*, which appears in other male register forms. The etymon *qaŋiʔ*/*ʔaŋiʔ* in Matu'uwal, Matu'aw, and S'uli may be a regional isogloss, since all three of these dialects are geographically contiguous. This would make \*qabay 'chin' the Proto-Atayal form, and Plngawan *ʔabalit* and Klesan *bəlit* may or may not have been innovated at a later stage. It is difficult to make a judgement call at this stage, so this form is not reconstructed to Proto-Atayal, but Plngawan and Klesan are assumed to have innovated the male register form instead of the other dialects losing it independently.

The word *putut* is not unique to Plngawan, S'uli, and Klesan, but it is unique in the meaning 'mosquito'. Squliq has *putut* 'midge' (小黑蚊), which is a very small bloodsucking insect *Forcipomyia Lasiohelea taiwana*. Squliq *putut* is not used to refer to mosquitoes, which are called only by the generic word for insects, *kuy*, and do not have a specialized term.

Plngawan and S'uli *ʔaraw* mean both 'branch' and 'rib', whereas this etymon means only 'rib' in other dialects (< Proto-Atayal \*qarag 'rib'). The Proto-Atayal etyma \*qaraʔ 'branch' and \*qarag 'rib' are probably not related: even though /g/ becoming /ʔ/ is a possible derivation strategy for male register forms, it is not used word-finally. At the very least, the two etyma can be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal, but may have been conflated later due to being phonetically similar. This is likely the case in Skikun as well, which has *qaraʔ* for both 'branch' and 'rib'.

A semantic shift also occurred in Plngawan, Klesan, and Matu'aw *kumis* 'fur, feathers, body hair'.^[I do not have S'uli data for this etymon, but I expect it to have the same semantics.] This word exists in other dialects, e.g. Squliq, but only with the meaning 'pubic hair', which is a direct reflex of PAn \*kumiS 'pubic hair'. Plngawan, Klesan, and Matu'aw extended the semantics of this etymon, whereas other dialects use distinct terms for 'fur' and 'feathers'. The word for 'fur' is distinct between Skikun, Squliq, and Matu'uwal, and cannot be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal; or alternatively, Proto-Atayal \*kumis had the additional meaning of 'fur'. However, there is the Proto-Atayal etymon \*palit meaning 'feathers, wing' (< PAn \*paNid 'wing'). Thus, extending the semantics of Proto-Atayal \*kumis to also mean 'feathers' is an innovation in Plngawan, Klesan, and Matu'aw.

The word for 'wing' is *ʔalih* in S'uli and Klesan, and *ʔalihuɹ* in Plngawan, which is the same etymon with a male register suffix. Squliq uses *paliʔ* 'wing', but the form *kaleh* can also be found. It appears similar, but does not correspond regularly with the other three dialects. We would expect Squliq \*\*qalih or similar if the term was inherited from Proto-Atayal by all dialects.

There are some additional forms that appear to be uniquely shared between Plngawan and Klesan, but there are few of these. Plngawan *paruʔ* and Klesan *pəru* mean 'axe', whereas other dialects have reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*yasam (Matu'aw has *ʔayasam* 'axe', but other dialects to not reflect the additional syllable). This may be an innovation that was later replaced in S'uli and Matu'aw, or the two etyma may in fact refer to different types of axes.

Plngawan *sunbaleʔ* and Klesan *kəbəle*, both meaning 'to build, make', point to a final glottal stop in the protoform, since the vowel in the final syllable is /e/ in both dialects, and Plngawan preserves the final glottal stop. Klesan does not have final glottal stops, but one had to be present in order for vowel coalescence to occur, as it did not happen to word-final \*-ay (see @sec:proto-atayal-to-cu for sound changes in Klesan). Matu'uwal *kabalay*, Squliq and Skikun *kəbalay* 'to build, make' do not reflect a final glottal stop. S'uli does not show this distinction in its reflexes, but S'uli *kəbalay* does not exhibit vowel lenition in the penultimate syllable (like Squliq and Skikun), which would be expected if the Proto-Atayal etymon ended in \*-aʔiʔ instead: cf. Proto-Atayal \*balaʔiq 'good' > S'uli *bəlay*, Klesan *bəle*. Unfortunately, I have not yet collected a Matu'uwal reflex, which will differentiate between the presence and absence of a word-final glottal stop in this etymon.

Another aberrant form is Plngawan *tin**un*** 'to weave (PV)' and Klesan *tənw**an*** 'to weave (LV)'.^[Klesan also has *tənun**an*** 'to weave (LV)', which is a reflex of the Proto-Atayal female register form \*tinun**an**. It preserved the male register form with no difference in meaning, but only in the Locative Voice.] These are cognate with the Matu'uwal male register form *tinuq**un*** 'to weave (PV)', but both Plngawan and Klesan have unexpected vowel coalescence in suffixed forms. We can use Matu'uwal evidence to reconstruct Proto-Atayal \*tinuq**un** 'to weave (PV)' or \*tinuq**an** 'to weave (LV)' for the male register form. In both Plngawan and Klesan, vowel coalescence does not normally occur across a historical \*q: cf. Proto-Atayal \*suq**un** 'to finish, to end (PV)' > Plngawan and Klesan *suʔ**un*** (not \*\*sun). We would expect Plngawan \*\**tinuʔ**un*** 'to weave (PV)' and Klesan \*\**tənuʔ**an*** 'to weave (LV)' if they followed the regular sound change processes (\*q > *ʔ* occurring after vowel coalescence). The reflexes in both Plngawan and Klesan thus mean that they share an irregularity, because vowel coalescence occurs unexpectedly in the same etymon. S'uli and Matu'aw only have reflexes of the Proto-Atayal female register form \*tinun**un**, and cannot be used for additional evidence here.

The Plngawan, S'uli, and Matu'aw reflexes of suffixed forms of the verb \*qələʔ**an** 'to close' point to a non-alternating \*u in the final syllable of the root : Matu'aw *ʔalw**an***, S'uli *ʔəlw**an***, and Plngawan *ʔul**on***, cf. Matu'uwal *qalʔ**an***, Squliq and Skikun *qələʔ**i*** (subjunctive *-i*), Klesan *ləʔ**an*** (see @sec:historical-schwa-alternations for more on this alternation). The form in Matu'aw, S'uli, and Plngawan contrasts with cognates in other dialects, where the root-final vowel becomes /ə/ after suffixation. (I reconstruct Proto-Atayal \*qələʔ**an** 'to close (LV)' based on these and the Actor Voice reflexes). Matu'aw, S'uli, and Plngawan point to an underlying /u/ vowel, which gets glided in the former two and coalesced in the latter (vowel coalescence is discussed in @sec:vowel-coalescence). On the other hand, Squliq, Skikun, and Klesan do not undergo vowel coalescence because underlying /ə/ does not trigger it, and thus the root-final glottal stop is preserved in these dialects. Matu'uwal does not have vowel coalescence as a phenomenon, but the form *qalʔ**an*** 'to close (LV)' reflects an alternating vowel in the root, which is regularly deleted in this environment (see @sec:historical-schwa-alternations for an explanation of this vowel alternation in Matu'uwal).

#### Shared innovations between S'uli, Matu'aw and Klesan {#sec:shared-innovations-su-kl}

Klesan shares additional innovations with S'uli and Matu'aw that Plngawan does not. These include male register forms not attested in other dialects, lexical innovations, semantic shifts, and aberrations in inherited etyma, all presented together in @tbl:innovations-su-kl. As before, S'uli stands in for Matu'aw as well, and Matu'aw cognates are given where no S'uli data is available.

A number of male register forms were clipped from the left edge to a shorter form, especially in Klesan. Matu'aw preserves the full-length forms, where the affixation is much more apparent, for example: Matu'aw *mamyux* 'cooked rice', S'uli and Klesan *myux*, cf. Squliq and Matu'uwal *mamiʔ*.

S'uli, Matu'aw, and Klesan have in some cases innovated new male register forms, distinct from male forms in other dialects, e.g. S'uli *həgayuŋ* and Klesan *gayuŋ* 'stone wall', cf. Squliq *hagaʔ*, Plngawan *haʔ*. The original female register form was most likely \*hagaʔ (this is deduced based on gender register affixation and comparisons of extant forms). The Plngawan *haʔ* is a male register form derived using \*g deletion with subsequent vowel coalescence, whereas the form in Klesan and S'uli was derived with suffixation.

In one case, I have S'uli *pəlyuŋ* 'cloth', which may be a male register form of Squliq *palaʔ* 'cloth'. Matu'aw *lalabah* and Klesan *balah* 'cloth' must be cognates, with metathesis in one or the other. I expect S'uli to have a reflex of the Matu'aw/Klesan etymon, perhaps in a different meaning, as it is unlikely that a new term was innovated to replace the old term, which was then replaced by a loan, which was modified with gender register morphology, all without leaving any traces in the language. S'uli is spoken in a considerable number of villages, and there is lexical variation that my data does not accurately capture.

S'uli and Klesan *sali* (Matu'aw *saliʔ*) means 'house', although this is not a lexical innovation: cf. Skikun *saliq* 'house in field'. However, Skikun *saliq* refers to a shelter in one's fields where people dwell only temporarily, during seasonal planting and harvesting, whereas in S'uli, Matu'aw, and Klesan this etymon refers to a permanent residence. This semantic shift and replacement of Proto-Atayal \*muɹag 'house' is unique to the latter three dialects.

S'uli and Klesan also share a very irregular form in the verb 'to suck'. In most other dialects a reflex of Proto-Atayal \***pasi**hub is found: Matu'uwal ***pəsi**hub*, Skikun ***pəsə**hup*, Squliq ***cə**hop* (with an innovative prefix *cə-*). On the other hand, both S'uli and Klesan have an irregular /t/ in word-final position in the Actor Voice form: S'uli ***pəsə**hut*, Klesan ***pəcə**hut*.^[Note that the prefix is reconstructed as \*pasi-, found here and elsewhere. The Klesan *pəcə-* here is another aberration, and not a productive affix.] The Locative Voice forms are suppletive: S'uli *səsib**an*** and Klesan *sib**i*** (with subjunctive LV suffix *-i*); but Matu'uwal *pəsihub**an*** is regular. This very specific and highly irregular verb is shared between S'uli and Klesan; Matu'aw forms are currently absent from my dataset.

#### Shared innovations between S'uli and Matu'aw {#sec:shared-innovations-su-mw}

In addition to all other innovations shared with Plngawan and Klesan, S'uli and Matu'aw also share some lexical innovations between themselves. Matu'aw is geographically very close to S'uli in Miaoli County, however there is no evidence of any significant influence of the larger S'uli dialect on Matu'aw. Sound correspondences in Matu'aw are regular and do not show any interference from S'uli, for example its vowel distinctions in the third-to-last syllable, discussed in @sec:prepenult-vowel-correspondences.

@tbl:su-mw-aberrations presents some lexical innovations as well as words with spontaneous sound changes that are shared between S'uli and Matu'aw. Klesan is given for comparison to demonstrate that these changes are unique to only the aforementioned two dialects. The forms in Klesan and Squliq are retentions from Proto-Atayal (except Squliq *pələqwiʔ*).

: Shared aberrations and lexical innovations in S'uli and Matu'aw {#tbl:su-mw-aberrations}

| S'uli       | Matu'aw     | Klesan      | Squliq     | Gloss             |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| latan       | balatan     | lukus       | lukus      | 'clothes'         |
| pələʔu      | palaʔuw     | məlabu      | pələqwiʔ   | 'white'           |
| lipuŋ       | talipuŋ     | ŋuŋu        | ŋuŋuʔ      | 'tail'            |
| təmaluŋ     | tamaluŋ     | məlikuy     | məlikuy    | 'man'             |
| k**əm**wih  | k**um**wih  | k**əm**oyah | k**əm**yuh | 'to dig'          |
| **mə**siwat | **ma**siwat | **mə**swat  | **mə**swat | 'to stop raining' |
<!-- fixme: lipung may be found in Sq too? -->

The words for 'clothes', 'white', 'tail', and 'man' are unique to S'uli and Matu'aw and not found elsewhere. Matu'aw *palaʔuw* and S'uli *pələʔu* does share some resemblance with Squliq *pələqwiʔ*, however apart the final vowel and the final consonant are both distinct. Squliq has a final glottal stop, while a final long vowel in Matu'aw suggests a historical final \*g.

S'uli *k**əm**wih* and Matu'aw *k**um**wih* 'to dig' may be related to Klesan *k**əm**oyah* and Squliq *k**əm**yuh*, but the vowels are all distinct, and the medial glide is /w/ in S'uli and Matu'aw, but \<y\> /j/ in Klesan and Squliq. Assuming these forms are indeed related and they underwent different sporadic changes, the change was shared between S'uli and Matu'aw. Skikun, Plngawan, and Matu'aw all use reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*k**um**ayhuɹ 'to dig'.

Another shared aberration is the penultimate vowel in S'uli ***mə**siwat* and Matu'aw ***ma**siwat* 'to stop raining', compare Matu'uwal ***ma**suwat*, Plngawan ***ma**sot*, Squliq, Skikun, and Klesan ***mə**swat*. Here I reconstruct Proto-Atayal \***ma**suwat 'to stop raining', as penultimate /i/ is unique to S'uli and Matu'aw, being a shared sporadic change.

There are also lexical items which appear in S'uli and Matu'aw and no other Atayal dialects, but can be found in Seediq. For example, S'uli *tələʔuŋ*, Matu'aw ***ma**talaʔuŋ* 'to sit', and Seediq *təluʔuŋ*, cf. Plngawan ***ma**tatamaʔ*, Squliq ***mə**tamaʔ*, Skikun *tamaʔ*, Klesan *tama*, and Matu'uwal ***man**tahuuk*. Another case is S'uli *k**əm**arip*, Matu'aw *k**um**arip*, and Truku Seediq *q**əm**arik* (AV), *qərib**un*** (PV) 'to cut with scissors', cf. Squliq *q**əm**atap*, Plngawan *ʔ**um**atak*, Klesan *k**əm**arak*. The regular correspondence of Seediq /q/ in Atayal is /q/, or /ʔ/ in dialects where /q/ was lost. The correspondence of /q/ in Seediq to /k/ in S'uli and Matu'aw is indicative of a borrowing relationship rather than a shared retention, with Seediq being the source. We have no such diagnostic for the etymon 'to sit', but there is no evidence of it appearing in Proto-Atayal, so it is likely a loan from Seediq as well, and again one that is shared exclusively between Matu'aw and S'uli.

### Shared innovations between Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun {#sec:shared-innovations-ml-sq-sk}

There is a number of lexical items that appear in Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun, but aren't found outside this group, neither in other Atayal dialects nor in Seediq. There are also words that are shared only between Matu'uwal and Skikun, presented in @sec:shared-innovations-ml-sk, and words unique to Skikun and Squliq, described in @sec:shared-innovations-sq-sk. There is no significant set of uniquely shared vocabulary between Matu'uwal and Squliq.

@tbl:unique-vocab-ml-sq-sk lists some lexical items common to all three dialects but not found outside the group. I am missing two words in my Skikun dataset, 'to harvest' and 'vein, sinew', but the etyma are still included in the table, and I expect cognates to be found in Skikun as well.

: Uniquely shared vocabulary in Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun {#tbl:unique-vocab-ml-sq-sk}

| Matu'uwal    | Squliq                | Skikun        | Gloss                |
|--------------|-----------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| qulih        | qulih                 | qulih         | 'fish'               |
| h**um**ab    | h**əm**ap 'to poke'   | h**əm**ap     | 'to poke, to stab'   |
| q**um**uwiʔ  | q**əm**uziʔ           | (q**əm**uliʔ) | 'to hang'            |
| q**um**uup   | q**əm**əzyup          | q**əm**uyup   | 'to fold'            |
| r**um**aʔraʔ | rəʔəraʔ 'watchtower'  | r**əm**əraʔ   | 'to keep watch'      |
| ŋaws**un**   | ŋos**un**             | (**sə**ŋos)   | 'sharp'              |
| q**um**ibug  | q**əm**ibuw           | q**əm**ibux   | 'to dig with shovel' |
| h**um**ibag  | h**əm**ibaw 'to reap' |               | 'to harvest'         |
| ʔuwiq        | ʔuwiq                 |               | 'vein, sinew'        |

The sound correspondences are regular and not indicative of a borrowing relationship, for example Matu'uwal *q**um**ibug*, Squliq *q**əm**ibuw*, Skikun *q**əm**ibux* 'to dig with a shovel', with regular reflexes of final \*g.

The amount of vocabulary uniquely shared by all three dialects is rather limited. The pairs Skikun-Matu'uwal and Skikun-Squliq have more uniquely shared cognates than Squliq-Matu'uwal. If Skikun-Matu'uwal and Skikun-Squliq share a closer genetic affinity with each other than with other Atayal dialects, then Squliq and Matu'uwal must also have a close genetic relationship by transitivity. However there is little direct lexical evidence for this. This suggests that Matu'uwal or Squliq replaced a portion of their shared lexical innovations, making their relationship more opaque.

#### Shared innovations between Matu'uwal and Skikun {#sec:shared-innovations-ml-sk}

Matu'uwal and Skikun are located far away from each other, with Matu'uwal in the foothills of Miaoli County, Tai'an Township, on the shores of the Rinax River (汶水溪), and Skikun in the mountains of Yilan County, Datong Township. There is no plausible way for a borrowing relationship between these two dialects, so any shared lexical items must be inherited.

Much of the shared vocabulary between Matu'uwal and Skikun consists of shared retentions, for example Matu'uwal *raniq* and Skikun *ryaniq* 'road', male register forms corresponding to Matu'uwal *raan* 'road' in the female register, ultimately from Proto-Austronesian \*zalan 'road'. Other Atayal dialects have replaced this etymon with reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*tuqig 'animal trail'. What might superficially seem like a shared innovation is in fact a uniquely shared retention that was lost in all other dialects. The only way to distinguish shared retentions from shared innovations is by looking at external evidence (@sec:external-evidence-lexical).

The lexical items in @tbl:ml-sq-innovations do not have such external evidence, and are assumed to be shared innovations until evidence to the contrary is found. These include completely novel lexical items, but also distinct male register forms, with Squliq, Plngawan, and Klesan given for comparison.

: Shared innovations in Matu'uwal and Skikun {#tbl:ml-sq-innovations}

| lalbiŋ         | ləbiŋ     | səbiŋ        | cacibiŋ     | cəbiŋ     | 'sweet'          |

There is no external evidence that suggests that the forms in @tbl:ml-sq-innovations are shared retentions in Matu'uwal and Skikun. In fact, there is evidence to the contrary for several forms, where the words in Squliq, Plngawan, and Klesan have cognates in Seediq: Tgdaya Seediq *ʔure* 'hungry', *bəheniq* 'twitch-up snare', *dəqeras* 'face'. The penultimate vowel in Tgdaya Seediq *bəheniq* 'twitch-up snare' does not correspond regularly with Squliq *bəhuniq*, Plngawan *bahuniʔ*, and Klesan *bəhoni*, which reflect \*u, but all other correspondences are regular.^[The semantics do not pose a major problem. A twitch-up snare involves a branch or a small tree which is bent and attached to a trigger on the ground. When the animal activates the trap and dislodges the trigger, the tree or branch snaps up. This action is similar to bending a bow to release the force stored in the wood, although in the case of a bow the force is released as a projectile. Cf. also Truku Seediq *bəhəniq* 'bow'.] Matu'uwal *buhinug* and Skikun *bəhenux* 'bow', as well as the etymon in other Atayal dialects and Seediq, ultimately descend from PAn \*busuR 'bow', but with different patterns of male register derivation. The female register form has not been attested in any dialect.

A very similar development can be observed in the etymon 'face', which can be traced to PAn \*daqiS. Squliq *rəq**ya**s*, Plngawan *ra**ɹe**s*, Klesan *rəʔe**ya**s*, and even Seediq *dəqe**ra**s* all reflect the etymon with the Proto-Atayalic infix \*-ra-.^[Plngawan *raɹes* appears to have undergone metathesis from earlier \*\*raʔiɹas to \*\*raʔɹi(y)as, after which the vowels were coalesced into /e/. The loss of \*ʔ is regular.] Matu'uwal *raqi**na**s* and Skikun *rəqe**na**s* have the infix *-na-* instead. The female register root was preserved in Matu'uwal *turaqis* 'to wash one's face'. The novel male register form appears to be an innovation in Matu'uwal and Skikun.

Matu'uwal *kahabaag* and Skikun *qabax* 'all' do not correspond regularly, but are similar enough for a possible connection. Final /g/ in Matu'uwal regularly corresponds to Skikun /x/, and the initial /q/ in Skikun would be a regular application of dorsal harmony before a pharyngeal fricative (see @sec:proto-atayal-to-sk for more information on dorsal harmony in Skikun). The irregularities are the additional vowel /a/ in Matu'uwal and the lack of a segment corresponding to /h/ from *kahabaag* in Skikun *qabax*.

The verb ***m**agal* 'to take (AV)' is the same in all Atayal dialects in its Actor Voice form (barring -l > -n mergers), but suffixed forms are slightly different: *ʔal**un*** in Matu'uwal and Skikun, and *gal**un*** elsewhere. Here it is not certain that the Matu'uwal and Skikun form is an innovation, but it is a likely scenario. Substituting a glottal stop for initial /g/ is a male register derivation strategy, and it may have been used in PV/LV forms of this verb.

Matu'uwal *lalbiŋ* and Skikun *ləbiŋ* 'sweet' reflect a historical \*l, but Squliq *səbiŋ*, Plngawan *cacibiŋ*, and Klesan *cəbiŋ* reflect historical \*c as the initial consonant of the root. This is not a unique occurrence of this correspondence, and it is found in other words in the Atayalic family, always in word-initial position: Matu'uwal and Skikun *lumiq*, Plngawan *lumiʔ*, Klesan *lumi* 'body louse', cf. Squliq *sumiq*, Seediq *cumiq*; Plngawan *ciŋas*, Truku Seediq *siŋas* 'food debris (stuck between teeth)', cf. Toda Seediq *liŋas*; Proto-Atayal \*c**um**abuʔ 'to wrap', cf. Seediq *l**əm**abu*. The change is sporadic, and it affects a different group of dialects in each case. The original sound was likely \*l in all cases, based on Proto-Austronesian correspondences, e.g. \*Ciŋas 'food debris' (although the correspondence of PAn \*s is irregular here, see @sec:pan-to-proto-atayal). The PAn etyma \*CəbuS 'sugarcane' and \*CuməS 'body louse' are likely related to tentative Proto-Atayalic \*cəbiŋ and \*cumiq,^[These are my own reconstructions.] but with the rime of the final syllable replaced using male register derivational morphology. The change of \*c to \*l would come later, though it is not necessarily related to gender register morphology.

#### Shared innovations between Squliq and Skikun {#sec:shared-innovations-sq-sk}

Care must be taken when discussing shared lexical innovations of any dialect with Squliq, due to the latter's immense influence on smaller dialects. It is possible that some of the lexical items presented in this section are in fact loaned by Skikun from Squliq, and not shared innovations. That being said, there are no items in my wordlist that were unambiguously borrowed from Squliq into Skikun: there are no instances of rhotacism or an /s/ where a \<c\> /t͡s/ would be expected. The only possible exception is Skikun *kəsyux* 'to borrow', cf. Squliq *kəsyuw*, but even here Skikun has final /x/, a reflex of historical \*g, which was lost in Squliq.

Lexical innovations shared between Squliq and Skikun are presented in @tbl:lex-innovations-sk-sq, with three other Atayal dialects given for comparison.

: Shared lexical innovations in Squliq and Skikun {#tbl:lex-innovations-sk-sq}

| Squliq        | Skikun        | Matu'uwal     | Plngawan     | Klesan     | Gloss      |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| ŋətaʔ         | ŋətaʔ         | wayluŋ        | wayluŋ       | weluŋ      | 'chicken'  |

| **mə**sətopaw | **mə**sətopaw | **ma**statail | **ma**staɹil | səboluk    | 'to jump'  |
| p**in**qzyuʔ  | p**in**qyuʔ   | kal**un**     | p**in**aɹit  | p**in**kyu | 'to tell'  |

Klesan *pinkyu* 'to tell' was borrowed from Squliq, as corroborated by the irregular correspondence of Squliq /q/ to Klesan /k/, which normally should correspond to Klesan /ʔ/ instead.

The lexical items in @tbl:lex-innovations-sk-sq are unique to Skikun and Squliq (except the aforementioned loanword), although they do not have any of the diagnostics that may have ascertained their status as inherited vocabulary and not loans. These diagnostics could have included rhotacism in Squliq, historical final \*g, or historical \*c, which have different reflexes in the two dialects (the \<c\> [t͡ɕ] in *qəmiciʔ* comes from historical \*t, as evidenced by its Squliq reflex).

Apart from lexical innovations, Squliq and Skikun also share a number of sporadic changes, listed in @tbl:sq-sk-aberrations. The table includes cognates from three other dialects for comparison.

: Shared aberrations in Squliq and Skikun {#tbl:sq-sk-aberrations}

| Squliq       | Skikun      | Matu'uwal   | Plngawan    | Klesan      | Gloss       |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| t**əm**abus  | t**əm**abus | t**um**apus | t**um**apis | t**əm**apus | 'to winnow' |
| **m**uʔ      | **m**uʔ     | c**um**buʔ  | c**um**buʔ  | c**əm**u    | 'to shoot'  |
| səzik        | sik         | saik        | saɹik       | (sigit)     | 'liver'     |
| h**əm**əbyaw | həbiyax     | bahaag      | (pariʔ)     | bəhyaw      | 'to chase'  |
| bəlaq        | bəlaq       | balaiq      | baleʔ       | bəle        | 'good'      |
| qani         | qani        | (hani)      | kani        | kwani       | 'this'      |
| qasa         | qaca        | (haca)      | kaca        | kyaca       | 'that'      |

The voicing of the medial consonant is Squliq and Skikun *t**əm**abus* 'to winnow' is irregular, and not reflected in Matu'uwal *t**um**apus*, Klesan *t**əm**apus*, or Plngawan *t**um**apis* (note the sporadic change of the vowel in Plngawan). We can confirm that the change in Squliq and Skikun (and Plngawan) is in fact an innovation using the PAn reconstructed form \*tapəS 'to winnow'.

The Squliq and Skikun verb ***m**uʔ* 'to shoot (AV)' is monosyllabic, but it is disyllabic in other dialects: Matu'uwal and Plngawan *c**um**buʔ*, Klesan *c**əm**u*. The initial syllable is lost during suffixation in all dialects: Matu'uwal *buʔ**un***, Squliq, Skikun, Plngawan, and Klesan *b**un*** 'to shoot (PV)'. This loss of the initial syllable can be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal \*buʔ**un** 'to shoot (PV)'. The change in the Actor Voice form in Squliq and Skikun is consistent with paradigm regularization (@sec:paradigm-leveling), but limited to these two dialects, and is likely a common innovation.

Matu'uwal *saik* and Plngawan *saɹik* 'liver' reflect a historical \*a in penultimate position, but Squliq *səzik* and Skikun *sik* point to \*ə in this position instead.

Squliq *h**əm**əbyaw* and Skikun *həbiyax* 'to chase' both show metathesis of the first two consonants. Compare Matu'uwal *bahaag*, Klesan *bəhyaw*, and also Truku Seediq *bəhəraw*. Note that S'uli *h**əm**yaw* shows this metathesis as well, although Klesan ***mə**hyaw* (base *bəhyaw*) does not. The metathesis in S'uli is most likely due to Squliq influence.

Squliq and Skikun *bəlaq* 'good' have an irregular vowel correspondence with Matu'uwal *balaiq*, Plngawan *baleʔ*, and Klesan *bəle*. The reconstructed Proto-Atayal form is \*balaʔiq, which should be regularly reflected in Squliq and Skikun as \*\*bəleq, showing vowel coalescence like Plngawan and Klesan. Notice that Squliq and Skikun lenite the penultimate vowel in *bəlaq*, suggesting that vowel lenition occurred before coalescence and ultimate vowel replacement.

Deictics in Squliq and Skikun both show sporadic backing of initial \*k into /q/: Squliq and Skikun *qani* 'this', cf. Plngawan *kani* and Klesan *kwani* (labialization in Klesan is also sporadic). Notice also that Skikun *qaca* regularly reflects \<c\> /t͡s/, unlike Squliq *qasa*, which merges it into /s/, cf. Plngawan *kaca*, Klesan *kyaca*. This backing also occurs in the nominal case marker: Squliq *qu*, Skikun *qa*, cf. Matu'uwal *ku*, Plngawan *ka*. Note that the case markers are different in Squliq and Skikun, but are equally affected by this backing process. This suggests a shared innovation rather than a borrowing relationship.

### Other shared aberrations {#sec:other-aberrations}

In addition to lexical innovations, the two dialect groups (Plngawan, S'uli, Klesan, and Matu'aw being one group, and Squliq, Matu'uwal, and Skikun the other) share aberrations in existing etyma, such as an irregular reflex of a segment, or metathesis. Due to the lack of external evidence for these etyma, it is not possible to tell which forms are inherited unchanged, and which are aberrant, thus they are listed here separately. Aberrant forms are listed in @tbl:north-south-shared-aberrations with examples from five dialects.

| kuncik      | kəsyuk      | kəsyu      | (kabaux)      | kəsyuw       | 'to borrow'      |

Just like in @sec:shared-innovations-pl-su-mw-cu and @sec:shared-innovations-ml-sq-sk, the dividing line here is between Plngawan, S'uli, Klesan, and Matu'aw on one side, and Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun on the other (Matu'aw and Skikun were omitted for space reasons).

Klesan shows borrowing influence from Squliq in two of its forms: *tatak* 'house in field' and *kəsyu* 'to borrow'. The latter case is quite telling, since Plngawan and S'uli have a final /k/ and Plngawan also has a \<c\> /t͡s/, both of which would be expected in a regular reflex in Klesan: \*\*kəcyuk. Squliq *kəsyuw* and Skikun *kəsyux* 'to borrow' indicate a historical final \*g and a medial \*s: Plngawan *kuncik* reflects \*c while Skikun *kəsyux* points to an \*s instead. Klesan *kəsyu* agrees with Squliq and Skikun on both accounts.

Plngawan ***ma**ʔapuŋ*, S'uli ***mə**ʔapuŋ*, and Klesan ***m**apuŋ* 'dry' all have /u/ in the final syllable, while Matu'uwal ***ma**ʔapiŋ* and Skikun *qapiŋ* have /i/ (there appears to be no reflex in Squliq). The vowels correspond along the same lines as other examples, but there is additional discrepancy between Matu'uwal and Skikun, where /q/ in Skikun appears to correspond to /ʔ/ in Matu'uwal. Since Plngawan, S'uli, and Klesan all lack a /q/ phoneme, it is not apparent whether Matu'uwal or Skikun underwent a sporadic change in this word.

Plngawan ***m**ulit* and Klesan ***mə**lyut* both have reflexes of \*-iyu-, but Matu'uwal ***mə**qaluwit* and Squliq ***mə**qəlwiʔ* suggest \*-uwi- instead. Metathesis occurred in one of these groups, but it is hard to tell which. The irregular final glottal stop in Squliq is explained in @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d.

The etymon 'to drink' merits further discussion due to being highly irregular. Its Actor Voice and Patient Voice forms in six dialects are given in @tbl:drink-av-pv (I do not have the S'uli PV form in my dataset). Almost all dialects exhibit suppletion between AV and PV, but the suppletive etyma differ among dialects.

: AV and PV forms of the verb 'to drink' in Atayal dialects {#tbl:drink-av-pv}

| Dialect   | 'to drink (AV)' | 'to drink (PV)' |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Matu'uwal | **mə**nubuwag   | nubu**un**      |
| Squliq    | **mə**nəbuw     | nəb**un**       |
| Skikun    | **mə**nəbux     | nəbux**un**     |
| Plngawan  | **ma**ʔabuʔ     | ʔab**un**       |
| Matu'aw   | **ma**nabuʔ     | nabug**un**     |
| Klesan    | nəbu            | nəb**un**       |

In the Actor Voice forms, Matu'uwal ***mə**nubuwag*, Squliq ***mə**nəbuw*, and Skikun ***mə**nəbux* all reflect a final \*g, however Plngawan ***ma**ʔabuʔ* and Matu'aw ***ma**nabuʔ* reflect a final \*ʔ instead (Klesan reflexes are ambiguous between the two). Matu'uwal additionally has a male register infix *-a-* [@li1983, pp. 9-10], but the expected female register form does not exist in the language. Plngawan sporadically changed root-initial \*n into /ʔ/.

In the Patient Voice, Squliq *nəb**un***, Plngawan *ʔab**un***, and Klesan *nəb**un*** have vowel coalescence, which happens only in roots with a final glottal stop (@sec:vowel-coalescence). Skikun *nəbux**un*** and Matu'aw *nabug**un*** both reflect a root-final \*g. Matu'uwal *nubu**un*** has a hiatus of identical vowels, which only happens in situations where a historical \*ɹ was deleted, so this form is puzzling (it also loses its male register infix).

The Actor Voice forms can be grouped in Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun on one side, reflecting final \*g, and Plngawan and Matu'aw on the other side, reflecting final \*ʔ. Klesan and S'uli have identical reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*g and \*ʔ in this environment, but presumably they would be in the latter group. The Patient Voice forms are more difficult to account for, and may have been regularized in those dialects that do not show suppletion (for more on regularization in verbal paradigms, see @sec:paradigm-leveling).

## Paradigm leveling {#sec:paradigm-leveling}

Different Atayal dialects have various consonant and vowel alternation processes that are especially visible in verbs, thanks to the complex verb morphology of the language. These alternation processes, described in @sec:synchronic-alternations, manifest in irregular verbs, which have to be learned specifically with the correct alternations. Paradigm leveling is the reversal of this process, or put in other words, it is the regularization of irregular verbs.

This regularization or paradigm leveling process evolved at different speeds in different dialects. Some dialects, like Matu'uwal or Matu'aw, have very little if any paradigm leveling, while others, like Skikun or Klesan, regularize a large portion of irregular verbs. It may be possible that this regularization process has sped up in recent decades due to language attrition among younger speakers, however it started long before today: Ogawa and Asai record the regularized Squliq form *k\<in\>at-an* 'to bite (LV.PFV)' in the beginning of the 20th Century [@ogawa1935, p. 47].

Some of the paradigm leveling processes are systematic, and affect whole classes of alternations. Other alternation processes may only be partly affected by regularization, as it can happen on a case-by-case basis. Both types are presented in this section.

Squliq, Skikun, and Klesan completely regularize all verbs with the root-final /t/ to \<c\> /t͡s/ alternation from @sec:merger-final-c-t. @tbl:regularization-final-t-to-c shows a comparison of alternating roots in Matu'uwal and Plngawan with their cognates in Squliq, Skikun, and Klesan, which do not have this alternation.

| hakuc**un**  | hakuc**un**     | həkut**un** | həkut**un** | kut**un**   | 'to move (PV)'  |

The verbs in Matu'uwal and Plngawan both have a phoneme that surfaces as /t/ if it coincides with the right edge of the word, but which becomes \<c\> /t͡s/ when followed by a suffix. This alternation is completely missing in Squliq, Skikun, and Klesan, fully replaced by a non-alternating /t/. (Note that the Klesan verb ***m**akut\~pəkut**an*** 'to ask' shows an irregular sound correspondence, and is likely loaned from Squliq, more on that in @sec:borrowings-cu.)

The remaining two dialects, Matu'aw and S'uli, do preserve the alternation, although due to the merger of \*c into \*s, the alternating phoneme surfaces as /s/ before suffixes: Matu'aw *y**um**iŋat\~yiŋas**un*** 'to rob', ***m**aʔut\~paʔus**an*** 'to ask', S'uli *k**əm**at\~kas**un*** 'to bite'.

Another regularization that works in a systematic manner is the leveling of the ∅ to /s/ alternation in Skikun. In most dialects, this alternating phoneme is absent from unsuffixed forms, and instead lengthens the preceding vowel /i/ (this alternation occurs only after the vowel /i/). When suffixed, it surfaces as an /s/ in most dialects, or as /r/ in Squliq and Plngawan due to rhotacism (see @sec:other-consonant-alternations). Skikun regularized all verbs with this alternation, and added a final /s/ onto unsuffixed forms, as shown in @tbl:skikun-regularization-s.

: Skikun regularization of ∅ to /s/ alternation {#tbl:skikun-regularization-s}

| Skikun     | Matu'uwal          | Squliq      | Gloss                   |
|------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **m**es    | **ma**baiy         | **mə**baziy | 'to buy (AV)'           |
| bes**un**  | bays**un**         | bəzir**un** | 'to buy (PV)'           |
| kəgis      | kəgiy              | kəgiy       | 'hemp'                  |
| kəgis**i** | k**am**kagis**an** | kəgir**i**  | 'to strip hemp (PV/LV)' |

Skikun is the only Atayal dialect that has a final /s/ in these verbs, and where the roots are regular. All other dialects have irregular verbs with this alternation. There is no environment to explain this irregularity in other dialects: final /-is/ is perfectly acceptable in all dialects, e.g. Matu'uwal *c**um**aqis\~caqis**un***, Plngawan *c**um**aʔis\~caʔis**un***, Squliq *s**əm**aqis\~səqis**un*** 'to sew'. The irregularity in words in @tbl:skikun-regularization-s must therefore be inherited, and was leveled out in Skikun only at a later stage. @li1981 used the occurrence of this final /s/ in Skikun to reconstruct the Proto-Atayal phoneme \*g', while in fact it is an artifact of a regularization process peculiar to Skikun alone (see @sec:li-proto-atayalic-g).

Another alternation mentioned in @sec:other-consonant-alternations is the alternation between /ʔ/ and /l/ in a few roots, reproduced in @tbl:squliq-regularization-gs-l. The forms marked by asterisks are taken from Shih [-@shih2008, p. 16], Chen [-@chen2012, p. 137], and Egerod [-@egerod1965, p. 262], the rest come from my own field notes.

: Squliq regularization of alternating /ʔ/ and /l/ {#tbl:squliq-regularization-gs-l}

| h**um**icuwaʔ | h**un**coʔ    | h**əm**əswaʔ | 'how (AV)'   |
| həcuwal**un** | hacol**un**\* | swaʔ**un**\* | 'how (PV)'   |

The table shows two verbs in Matu'uwal and Plngawan having an alternation between /ʔ/ in unsuffixed forms and /l/ in suffixed forms. Other dialects, like Skikun and Klesan, also have the alternation in the verb 'to go': Skikun ***m**usaʔ\~sal**an***, Klesan ***m**osa\~sal**an***. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find or elicit the PV form of 'how' in other dialects.

On the other hand, Squliq has no consonant alternation in either of these two verbs. Note that the form *swaʔ**un*** 'how (PV)' [taken from @egerod1965, p. 262] does not show vowel coalescence, even though it applies in the forms *ʔəs**an*** 'to go (LV)' and *ʔəs**on*** 'to go (PV)'. A possible explanation for this is that the regularization of these two verbs occurred at different times, with 'to go' regularizing first and therefore undergoing vowel coalescence. Other verbs in Egerod's data do show vowel coalescence in the same environment, so it is unlikely to be dialectal variation.

There are also regularizations of individual roots, that are not part of a larger pattern of regularization. For example, the verb 'to close', shown in @tbl:regularization-close, has an alternating schwa vowel in the final syllable in Matu'uwal, Squliq, Skikun, and Klesan (see @sec:historical-schwa-alternations). However, it is regular in Plngawan, Matu'aw, and S'uli.

: Regularization of the verb 'to close' in Plngawan, Matu'aw, and S'uli {#tbl:regularization-close}

| Matu'uwal  | Squliq      | Plngawan   | Matu'aw     | S'uli      | Gloss           |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| q**um**luʔ | q**əm**əluʔ | ʔ**un**luʔ | ʔ**um**aluʔ | ʔ**əm**əlu | 'to close (AV)' |
| qalʔ**an** | qələʔ**an** | ʔul**on**  | ʔalw**an**  | ʔəlw**an** | 'to close (PV)' |

The PV forms in Matu'aw and S'uli have the vowel /u/ changing into a glide /w/ before the LV suffix *-an*, which happens with non-alternating vowels. Plngawan coalesces the two vowels into a mid vowel /o/, as it usually does (see @sec:vowel-coalescence). Compare this to the Squliq PV form *qələʔ**an*** or the Klesan *ləʔ**an***, where there is no gliding or vowel coalescence and the glottal stop is preserved. However, this regularization is not part of a larger pattern of regularizing historical schwa vowels in Plngawan, Matu'aw, and S'uli, and is instead a one-off case.

Plngawan also regularizes some verbs with the /k/ to /p/ alternation in the root. Plngawan, along with Klesan, merges labials into velars word-finally (see @sec:merger-labial-velar). However, in a few verbs in my data, this neutralized velar was then extended to suffixed forms as well, as shown in @tbl:regularization-plngawan-p-k.

: Regularization of some /p/ to /k/ alternating verbs in Plngawan {#tbl:regularization-plngawan-p-k}

| **ma**loɹak       | q**um**aluwap    | 'to hunt (AV)'    |

| **pa**nek         | **pa**naip       | 'to fish (AV)'    |
| **pa**nek**an**   | **pa**nayp**an** | 'to fish (LV)'    |

There are still many verbs in Plngawan that preserve the /p/ to /k/ alternation, e.g. ***m**aɹuk\~kaɹup**an*** 'to enter', *y**um**uk\~yup**un*** 'to blow', *h**un**yak\~hayap**an*** 'to suck'. The verbs in @tbl:regularization-plngawan-p-k may have been regularized because their suffixed forms are not used very often in everyday speech, and have since been attrited.

## Interdialectal lexical borrowings {#sec:interdialectal-borrowings}

When comparing lexical items, special care should be taken to account for potential borrowings. In the case of interdialectal borrowings, by far the most likely source is Squliq, which is the prestige dialect spoken by the overwhelming majority of Atayal speakers. Squliq occupies the largest territory of all Atayal dialects, and all Atayal dialects except Plngawan are bordered by Squliq. Many lexical borrowings in Klesan (@sec:borrowings-cu), presented below, originate in Squliq, and this is corroborated by irregular sound correspondences, which reflect sound changes in Squliq.

The case of Plngawan is different, as it is an Atayal enclave, surrounded by Seediq and Bunun, but far from other Atayal dialects. The majority of identifiable loanwords in Plngawan (excepting Japanese and Sinitic loans) come from various Seediq dialects. As Seediq is most closely related to Atayal, it is important to separate these loans from inherited vocabulary, which is not always simple. My findings are given in @sec:borrowings-pl.

### Borrowings in Klesan {#sec:borrowings-cu}

There is a noticeable stratum of borrowed Atayalic vocabulary in Klesan.^[Klesan also borrows from Japanese a lot more heavily than other dialects, but these loans are much easier to identify.] Some lexical items have irregular sound correspondences, and are instead phonetically simisal to Squliq words. Regular sound correspondences are a relic of systematic sound changes. In contrast, when correspondences are not regular or systematic, they indicate a contact relationship instead. This is also true of situations where a sound change is 'optional', leading to several variant pronunciations: in these cases a native form is competing with a cognate loaned from a related dialect. The following irregular correspondences can be found in these loans:

- Klesan /k/ corresponding to Squliq and Matu'uwal /q/. The regular correspondence in Klesan should be /ʔ/.
- Klesan /t/ being palatalized into [t͡ɕ] before a high front vowel. There is no regular palatalization in Klesan, so this cases of affricated /t/ are a result of language contact, not regular sound changes.
- Rhotacism in Klesan. This sound change did not occur in the dialect, but it did happen in Squliq.

Examples of Atayal etyma with irregular correspondences in Klesan are given in @tbl:kl-irreg-correspondences. All three of the above irregular correspondences are present. Matu'uwal and S'uli are given for comparison where cognates can be found.

: Words with irregular sound correspondences in Klesan {#tbl:kl-irreg-correspondences}

| cipok      | cipoq       |             |            | 'a little'        |

Squashes are a New World plant, so it is not surprising that the term for them is a borrowing in at least one language. However, S'uli *ʔabaŋ* has a regular sound correspondence with Squliq, reflecting /ʔ/ for initial /q/ in Squliq, whereas the form in Klesan has an irregular /k/ instead.

Klesan *cira* 'spindle' is an instance of both affrication of /t/ and rhotacism. The Matu'uwal form ***ma**tisaʔ* reflects Proto-Atayal \***ma**tisaʔ with no changes, but Squliq *ciraʔ* exhibits affrication of /t/ before /i/, and rhotacism of \*s following a high front vowel and before a stressed vowel (see @sec:proto-atayal-to-sq for sound changes in Squliq). Neither of these changes regularly apply in Klesan, see for example *bəgisa* 'shuttle (of loom)' or *bətisa* 'part of loom'.^[Klesan *bətisa* 'part of loom' might actually be cognate with Proto-Atayal \***ma**tisaʔ 'spindle'.]

There are no cognates of Squliq ***mə**cisal* 'to play' in Matu'uwal and S'uli in my database, however cf. Plngawan and Matu'aw ***ma**tisal* 'to play, to visit'. Klesan speakers actually allow both *cisan* and *tisan* with no difference in meaning. This is another clue that words with affrication are not the result of regular sound changes.

Some words, like Squliq *cipoq* 'a little' do not appear to have cognates in other dialects at all. The corresponding Klesan *cipok* not only has an irregular sound correspondence, but it is also a uniquely Squliq lexical item that was then borrowed into Klesan.

Some words may have doublets in Klesan, such as *tisan* or *cisan* 'to play', *yeyik* or *zəzik* 'deep', and *hyuti* or *hyuci* 'slippery'. These doublets have no semantic difference, and can be freely substituted for one another. One of these doublets shows the expected Klesan reflexes of Proto-Atayal etyma, while the other has changes that happened in Squliq, but that Klesan did not undergo.

Apart from the considerable number of words with irregular sound correspondences, Klesan also has words with no apparent irregularities, but that are more similar in form to Squliq that other dialects, or else only found in Squliq, e.g. *tatak* 'house in field' and *kəsyu* 'to borrow' from @sec:other-aberrations. The influence of Squliq in Klesan is quite strong, and there are likely other loanwords that are more difficult, if not impossible, to identify.

### Borrowings in Plngawan {#sec:borrowings-pl}

Plngawan speakers have had historically close relations with Seediq speakers, including frequent intermarriage. The Seediq people in the vicinity of Plngawan speak three major dialects of Seediq: Tgdaya, Toda, and Truku. Plngawan does not show a closer contact relationship with any of the three, and instead have loans that may correspond to any single Seediq dialect.

@li1985 noted the presence of Seediq words in Plngawan and concluded that they were loans. He gives a detailed comparison of the Plngawan vocabulary to those of other Atayal dialects and to Seediq, and concludes that Plngawan is indeed an Atayal dialect (which was not common knowledge at the time).

Some Seediq loanwords into Plngawan are shown in @tbl:pl-loans. If a word is present in the Tgdaya dialect, it is not marked. If it is only found in the Truku dialect, it is marked with '(Tr)'. Matu'uwal and Klesan are given for comparison, but the words in the table are not Atayal cognates.

Unlike Klesan, Seediq loanwords in Plngawan are usually not determined using irregular sound correspondences (though that is sometimes useful), but simply by not having any cognates in Atayal at all.

Plngawan *sapit* 'shoes' is distinct from the Proto-Atayal \*ɹamil 'shoes', cf. Truku Seediq *ramil* 'slippers'. It may be related to Hoanya *sapit* 'shoes', though the nature of Plngawan or Seediq contact with Hoanya, a Western Plains group whose language has long since gone extinct, is uncertain.

In a few lexical items, Plngawan has an Atayal cognate, but with an irregular sound change that is also found in Seediq. For example, Plngawan *ʔ**um**pix* and Truku Seediq *ʔəpix* 'to press', cf. Proto-Atayal \*ʔ**um**əpux. The last vowel is irregularly changed to /i/ in both Plngawan and Truku Seediq, but not other Seediq dialects, cf. Tgdaya Seediq ***m**epux* 'to press'. Plngawan still preserves a historical alternating vowel in some forms: AV subjunctive *ʔapix* or *ʔapux*, LV *ʔapix**an*** or *apx**an***. The presence of both forms in Plngawan suggests that it is the recipient, and not the source of the loan. Truku Seediq can thus be identified as the source of the Plngawan aberration.

The language contact between Plngawan and Seediq was protracted, and persisted before and after sound changes in the former. This can be seen in sound correspondences, where Seediq /q/ may correspond to either /ʔ/ or /k/ in Plngawan, and Seediq /r/ may correspond to Plngawan /ɹ/ or /r/: Truku Seediq *qəpatur* and Plngawan *ʔapatuɹ* 'frog', but Seediq *c**əm**ilaq* 'to snap' and Plngawan *c**um**ilak* 'to cut open', Seediq *r**um**igaw* and Plngawan *r**um**igaw* 'to walk around, to stroll'. Words where Seediq /q/ and /r/ correspond to Plngawan /ʔ/ and /ɹ/, respectively, must be very early loans that underwent sound changes together with native vocabulary. Words where Seediq /q/ and /r/ correspond to Plngawan /k/ and /r/ are newer borrowings.

## External evidence for lexical reconstructions {#sec:external-evidence-lexical}

External evidence from both Seediq and Proto-Austronesian can help with lexical reconstructions. Some etyma preserve only the male register form in all dialects except one or two, and it is not always clear which forms can be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal.

Shared innovations and shared retentions in the lexicon can be tricky to distinguish without external evidence. If the same etymon is found in either Proto-Austronesian or Seediq, then it can be treated as a shared retention.

External evidence from Seediq is presented in @sec:evidence-from-seediq-lexical, and Proto-Austronesian etyma used for lexical reconstructions are discussed in @sec:evidence-from-pan-lexical.

### Evidence from Seediq {#sec:evidence-from-seediq-lexical}

Seediq cognates can be helpful in situations where there is uncertainty about retention versus innovation, and there are no Proto-Austronesian cognates. Seediq, being the most closely related language to Atayal, has the highest percentage of shared vocabulary with it. It is the first place to look when faced with a lack of internal evidence.

Some examples of Seediq evidence (Truku dialect) are presented in @tbl:sed-external-evidence, together with conflicting evidence in Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Klesan.

: Seediq evidence for Proto-Atayal reconstructions {#tbl:sed-external-evidence}

| Proto-Atayal        | Matu'uwal    | Squliq       | Klesan    | Truku Seediq | Gloss      |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| \text{*}**ma**ʔuɹay | **ma**sqayuŋ | **mə**ʔuzyay | **m**uyay | **mu**ʔuray  | 'hungry'   |
| \text{*}l**um**aʔum | c**um**uliŋ  | l**əm**om    | l**əm**oŋ | l**əm**auŋ   | 'to burn'  |
| \text{*}bVhuniq     | buhinug      | bəhuniq      | bəhoni    | bəhəniq      | 'bow'      |
| \text{*}tuhiyaq     | tatuhiʔ      | twahiq       | təhəya    | təhiyaq      | 'far'      |
| \text{*}bVhərag     | bahaag       | həbəyaw      | bəhyaw    | bəhəraw      | 'to chase' |

In some cases, the lack of cognates makes it difficult to decide whether a certain etymon should be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal, or whether it is a later innovation. If it can be found in Seediq, it can be safely reconstructed to Proto-Atayal, and from there also to Proto-Atayalic. Such is the case with Proto-Atayal \***ma**ʔuɹay 'hungry' and \*l**um**aʔum 'to burn'. These etyma are not found in all dialects, and other dialects may have competing etyma, such as Matu'uwal ***ma**sqayuŋ* and Skikun *səqiyuŋ* 'hungry'. It is not clear whether the Matu'uwal and Skikun forms are retentions or innovations. Truku Seediq ***mu**ʔure* suggests that Proto-Atayal \***ma**ʔuɹay 'hungry' should be reconstructed, and that the Matu'uwal and Skikun forms are likely later innovations.

Other times the lexical item is not replaced, but rather modified through a spontaneous sound change or using gender register morphology. Here Seediq can again be helpful in identifying older, less innovative forms: Matu'uwal *buhinug* and Skikun *bəhenux* 'bow' have a different affix from Squliq *bəhuniq* and Klesan *bəhoni* 'bow', even though all are ultimately descended from PAn \*busuR 'bow'. Truku Seediq *bəhəniq* 'bow' suggests that the Squliq and Klesan forms are not innovations, and can be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal.

### Evidence from PAn reconstructions {#sec:evidence-from-pan-lexical}

Proto-Austronesian etyma can be very useful in reconstructing Proto-Atayal forms. Some retentions can only be found in one or two dialects, and they cannot be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal without external evidence, which PAn provides.

@tbl:pan-external-evidence presents some examples where PAn etyma can assist in choosing the correct form to reconstruct to Proto-Atayal.

: External evidence from PAn for Proto-Atayal reconstructions {#tbl:pan-external-evidence}

| PAn            | Proto-Atayal  | Matu'uwal   | Squliq  | Plngawan      | Gloss      |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|---------|---------------|------------|
| \text{*}paNid  | \*palit       | paliʔ       | paliʔ   | ʔalihuɹ       | 'feather'  |
| \text{*}qaNiC  | \*q**um**alit | q**um**aliʔ | qəmilis | ʔumalit       | 'to peel'  |
| \text{*}mula   | \***m**umuɹaʔ | **m**umuwaʔ | muhiʔ   | **si**pamuhiʔ | 'to plant' |
| \text{*}Caliŋa | \*caŋiyaʔ     | caŋiyaʔ     | papak   | caŋeʔ         | 'ear'      |
| \text{*}zalan  | \*raɹan       | raan        | tuqiy   | tuʔuy         | 'road'     |
| \text{*}Səpi   | \*səpiʔ       | sapiyal     | səpiʔ   | sipel         | 'dream'    |
| \text{*}damuq  | \*ramuʔ       | ramuux      | ramuʔ   | ramuɹux       | 'blood'    |

Matu'uwal, Squliq, and Skikun share the form *paliʔ* 'feather', which is not found in other Atayal dialects. Since these three dialects have a number of shared innovations, this word might also be assumed an innovation. However, it has cognates in Seediq *palic* 'wing' and PAn \*paNid 'wing'. Using external evidence from both sources, it can be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal. The change of the final obstruent to a glottal stop in Atayal is discussed in @sec:li-proto-atayalic-d.

Matu'uwal ***m**umuwaʔ* and Skikun *muyaʔ* 'to plant' are uniquely shared cognates. With just two dialects that also share a number of innovations, it is easy to overlook this word and assume it must be an innovation as well. However the PAn etymon \*mula 'to plant' is reflected regularly in both, allowing us to reconstruct Proto-Atayal \***m**umuɹaʔ.

In other cases, Matu'uwal has a male register form, but no corresponding female register form, but the female register form can be found in another dialect: Matu'uwal *ramuux* and Plngawan *ramuɹux* 'blood' have male register affixation, but Squliq *ramuʔ* does not. The Squliq form corresponds with PAn \*damuq 'blood',^[Here PAn final \*q is irregularly reflected in Atayal as /ʔ/.] allowing us to reconstruct both the male and the female register forms, and connect Atayal reflexes with the PAn etymon.

In a distinct class of correspondences, a female register in Matu'uwal corresponds regularly with PAn, but all (or most) other Atayal dialects only preserve the reflex of the male register form. Without an understanding of gender register system and the PAn etyma, only the male register form could be reconstructed. Instead, we can utilize our knowledge of male register forms as derived, and directly compare the female register forms with PAn reconstructions. Some of these comparisons are presented in @tbl:pan-etyma-fem-ml, with both the female and male register form in Matu'uwal as well as Squliq cognates.

| PAn           | Matu'uwal (f) | Matu'uwal (m) | Squliq  | Gloss        |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| \text{*}kuCu  | kucuʔ         | kuhiŋ         | kuhiŋ   | 'head louse' |
| \text{*}qaRəm | qagum         | qaum          | qom     | 'pangolin'   |
| \text{*}zaRum | ragum         | raum          | rom     | 'needle'     |
| \text{*}Sapuy | hapuy         | hapuniq       | puniq   | 'fire'       |
| \text{*}CuNuh | c**um**uluh   | c**um**uliŋ   | səmuliŋ | 'to roast'   |
| \text{*}NataD | lataʔ         | latanux       | tanux   | 'outside'    |
| \text{*}ŋipən | gipun         | giʔnux        | gəʔənux | 'teeth'      |
| \text{*}Cali  | caiʔ          |               | sehuy   | 'taro'       |
| \text{*}taNək | t**um**aluk   | t**um**ahuk   | təmahuk | 'to cook'    |
| \text{*}taRaq | t**um**agaq   | t**um**aq     | təmaq   | 'to carve'   |

In some cases, Seediq evidence can be misleading: compare Matu'uwal *kuhiŋ*, Squliq *kuhiŋ*, and Seediq *quhiŋ* 'head louse'. Of all the dialects in Atayal and Seediq, only Matu'uwal preserves the female register form *kucuʔ*, corresponding to PAn \*kuCu 'head louse'. Here familiarity with the gender register system is helpful: we know from other evidence that the female register preserves inherited forms unchanged, while the male register modifies them. Seediq reflexes underscore the fact that the gender register was productive before the split of Proto-Atayalic into Atayal and Seediq.

We can also use PAn forms to reconstruct ambiguous segments. Matu'uwal *caiʔ* 'taro' has a hiatus, which may have come from the deletion of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ or \*ʔ between the two vowels. Since no other dialect has a reflex of the female register form, we have to rely on external evidence. Luckily, PAn \*Cali provides it, allowing us to reconstruct Proto-Atayal \*caɹiʔ 'taro' in the female register.

When reconstructing the Proto-Atayal lexicon, I paid special attention to Proto-Austronesian reconstructions that matched a form found only in one or two dialects, especially female register forms in Matu'uwal. Even though I have found PAn cognates for only about 10% of the reconstructed Proto-Atayal vocabulary, these additional forms reconstructed with external evidence give us a better picture of the Proto-Atayal language.

## Interim summary

This chapter began with the reconstruction of the voice morphology in Proto-Atayal, and followed it with lexical reconstructions. I devoted much attention to the unique Atayal phenomenon of gendered speech registers, whereby men's speech is derived in unpredictable ways, using any of a large number of derivational strategies.

The bulk of the chapter was dedicated to lexical innovations. Here I already grouped together the dialects which share the most innovations and aberrations with each other. The gender register system also plays a role here, since novel male register forms were being innovated in Atayal dialects long after the split of Proto-Atayal.

Along with lexical innovations, I also discussed lexical borrowings between Atayal dialects, or between Atayal and closely related Seediq. I looked at ways of identifying such borrowings, and examined two dialects in particular due to the large amount of interdialectal loanwords they have: Klesan and Plngawan.

I also discussed the phenomenon of paradigm leveling in verbs, whereby consonant alternations that are normally induced by suffixation are regularized in some dialects. A better understanding of these regularization processes allows us to make more accurate reconstructions.

Alongside sound changes, lexical innovations and aberrations form the second cornerstone of subgrouping evidence, which is summarized in the next chapter.

# Atayal subgrouping {#sec:atayal-subgrouping}

This chapter brings together the evidence from Chapters 4 and 5 to propose a subgrouping hypothesis of Atayal dialects. First, I present the new subgrouping in @sec:subgrouping-proposal. I then go over the phonological and lexical evidence for each individual node of the tree in [@sec:northern-atayal-evidence;@sec:southern-atayal-evidence]. Finally, I make some generalizations from the subgrouping and compare it with the old subgrouping proposal in @sec:subgrouping-summary.

## Subgrouping proposal {#sec:subgrouping-proposal}

The subgrouping of Atayal dialects, based on both phonological and lexical innovations, is presented in @fig:subgrouping.

\begin{figure}[h]

      [ Plngawan, tier=lang ] ] ]
\end{forest}
\caption{Atayal dialect subgrouping}
\label{fig:subgrouping}
\end{figure}

I divide Atayal dialects into two main subgroups based on lexical and phonological evidence: (1) Northern Atayal, consisting of Squliq, Skikun, and Matu'uwal, and (2) Southern Atayal, comprising S'uli, Matu'aw, Klesan, and Plngawan. The two main subgroups are named for their approximate geographical positions relative to each other. Each subgroup is defined by common sound changes, lexical innovations (including completely novel lexical items as well as innovative male register forms) and sporadic changes shared by two or more dialects (shared aberrations). Both groups can be further subdivided based on the same principles.

Within the Northern subgroup, there is a division into Nuclear Nothern Atayal (Squliq and Skikun) and Matu'uwal. In the Southern subgroup, the first split was into Nuclear Southern Atayal and Plngawan. The former then split into Southwestern Atayal (S'uli and Matu'aw) and Klesan.

Matu'uwal and Plngawan are the primary offshoots of the Northern Atayal and Southern Atayal subgroups, respectively. This is based on negative evidence: there is no direct evidence of their branching off earlier, but there is evidence that the remaining dialects in their respective subgroups are more closely related to each other.

This subgrouping is based on phonological and lexical evidence, both of which are discussed in the following sections. Neither one takes precedence overall, though lexical evidence is perhaps somewhat more useful in determining the subdivisions within Southern Atayal. On the whole, there is no disagreement between the two, which speaks to the veracity of the proposal.

## Evidence for a Northern Atayal subgroup {#sec:northern-atayal-evidence}

The grouping of Matu'uwal, Skikun, and Squliq into the Northern Atayal subgroup is supported by both lexical evidence and by a single, but very specific sound change.

The phonological evidence is the merger of Proto-Atayal word-final \*-lit and \*-liʔ, which is common to all three dialects. Two of the dialects also share an exception to the merger in the same etymon: Matu'uwal *qawlit* and Skikun *qolit* 'mouse, rat'. The reflexes of Proto-Atayal consonant phonemes in Proto-Northern Atayal (PNA) and Matu'uwal are presented in @tbl:pa-to-pna-consonants.

The changes from Proto-Atayal to Proto-Northern Atayal were minimal. Only the merger of Proto-Atayal final \*-lit and \*-liʔ as well as dorsal consonant harmony in the Proto-Atayal roots \*kuriq 'to steal', \*kaniq 'to eat', and \*kəbaq 'to know' occurred in consonants. Matu'uwal later underwent its complex changes of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ, and deleted Proto-Atayal \*ʔ in the environments a\_í and a\_ú.

There were no changes in vowels from Proto-Atayal to Proto-Northern Atayal, as can be seen in @tbl:pa-to-pna-vowels. Further changes of Proto-Atayal penultimate \*ə occurred in Matu'uwal, where it was deleted in the environment VC\_CV, and assimilated to a following vowel if there was an intervening \*ɹ in Proto-Atayal (which was deleted in Matu'uwal).

The Northern group has lexical innovations common to all three dialects, such as Matu'uwal, Squliq, Skikun *qulih* 'fish' (< Proto-Northern Atayal \*qulih); or Matu'uwal *h**um**ab*, Squliq and Skikun *h**əm**ap* 'to poke, to stab' (< Proto-Northern Atayal \*h**um**ab). The full list of lexical innovations in Proto-Northern Atayal is presented in @tbl:pna-innovations, along with Proto-Atayal forms that they replaced.

Further subgrouping is difficult with lexical evidence alone, though shared aberrations as well as sound changes help establish the closer relationship of Squliq and Skikun, discussed below in @sec:nuclear-northern-atayal-evidence. Nevertheless, Matu'uwal does uniquely share a not-insignificant number of words with Skikun (@sec:shared-innovations-ml-sk). Some of these are retentions, as evidenced by cognacy with Seediq or Proto-Austronesian etyma, but some are lexical innovations, for example Matu'uwal *cuŋaʔ* and Skikun *cyuŋaʔ* 'in the past, long ago'; or the aberrant root-initial consonant in Matu'uwal *lalbiŋ* and Skikun *ləbiŋ* 'sweet', cf. Squliq *səbiŋ*, Klesan *cəbiŋ*. Ultimately, shared lexical and phonological innovations between Squliq and Skikun overshadow the few unique cognates between Matu'uwal and Skikun. A possible explanation is that these Matu'uwal/Skikun cognates were innovations in Northern Atayal, but were later replaced in Squliq, erasing the evidence.

### Evidence for a Nuclear Northern Atayal subgroup {#sec:nuclear-northern-atayal-evidence}

Within the Northern Atayal subgroup, Skikun could be closer either to Squliq or to Matu'uwal, according to lexical evidence. However, shared innovations between Skikun and Matu'uwal are limited to a modest number of lexical items, while Squliq shares both lexical innovations and aberrations with Skikun. Moreover, Squliq and Skikun share five sound changes with each other that Matu'uwal did not undergo, which are:

- merger of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ and \*y,
- liquid assimilation,
- affrication of Proto-Atayal \*t,
- Proto-Atayal final \*-b devoicing,
- prepenultimate vowel lenition.

Each one of these sound changes does not constitute compelling evidence on its own, but five changes together, supported by shared innovations and aberrations in the lexicon, are a lot more convincing. Fortition of Proto-Atayal \*w in the third-to-last syllable must also have occurred at this stage, see reflexes of Proto-Atayal \*wariyuŋ 'neck' and \*waqanux 'sambar deer'. The specific definitions of all sound changes are given in @sec:proto-atayal-to-dialects. @tbl:pa-to-pnna-consonants demonstrates how these changes affected Proto-Atayal consonants in Proto-Nuclear Nothern Atayal (PNNA).

Proto-Atayal word-final \*g was still present in Proto-Nuclear Northern Atayal, as evidenced by different reflexes in Skikun and Squliq. It underwent different changes in these two dialects, devoicing in Skikun to merge with Proto-Atayal \*x, and leniting in Squliq, becoming /w/ after \*a and ∅ after high vowels (with compensatory lengthening).

Vowels in Proto-Nuclear Northern Atayal underwent prepenultimate weakening and monophthongization, as seen in @tbl:pa-to-pnna-vowels. Previous disyllabic sequences CV.GVC were changed into monosyllabic CGVC if the penultimate vowel and the glide were homorganic, e.g. Proto-Atayal \*buwax 'unhusked rice' > Proto-Northern Atayal \*bwax. They did not change further in Squliq or Skikun.

Squliq also shares lexical innovations and aberrations in a number of words uniquely with Skikun (@sec:shared-innovations-sq-sk). Examples include Squliq and Skikun *ŋətaʔ* 'chicken', Squliq and Skikun *tatuʔ* 'incisors (front teeth)', Squliq and Skikun *s**əm**oyaʔ* 'to like'.

We may suspect that Squliq, as by far the largest Atayal dialect, could have influenced Skikun through language contact, however I have found no evidence of such a relationship, unlike with Klesan and S'uli: Skikun does not have a layer of vocabulary with irregular correspondences that can be linked to borrowings from Squliq, but Klesan and S'uli do (the loan layer in Klesan is discussed in @sec:borrowings-cu).

Shared aberrations in particular are a crucial piece of evidence in ascertaining a close genetic relationship between Squliq and Skikun: sporadic voicing of Proto-Atayal \*p into /b/ in Squliq and Skikun *t**əm**abus* 'to winnow', cf. Proto-Atayal \*t**um**apus; sporadic vowel change of Proto-Atayal \*-aʔi- to /-a-/ in Squliq and Skikun *bəlaq* 'good', cf. Plngawan *baleʔ*, Klesan *bəle*, from Proto-Atayal \*balaʔiq; irregular penultimate vowel weakening in Squliq *səzik* and Skikun *sik* 'liver', cf. Matu'uwal *saik* and Plngawan *saɹik*, from Proto-Atayal \*saɹik. The full list of lexical innovations and aberrations in Nuclear Nothern Atayal is presented in @tbl:pnna-innovations.

The backing of Proto-Atayal \*k in deictics and case markers is an important innovation: Squliq *qasa* and Skikun *qaca* 'that' (< Proto-Nuclear Northern Atayal \*qaca), cf. Plngawan *kaca* and Klesan *kyaca*; or Squliq *qu* and Skikun *qa*, a nominative case marker, cf. Matu'uwal *ku* and Plngawan *ka*. Crucially, the sound correspondence between Squliq *qasa* and Skikun *qaca* is regular, and the case markers have different forms altogether, which precludes borrowing, but they still share this backing phenomenon.

## Evidence for a Southern Atayal subgroup {#sec:southern-atayal-evidence}

The four dialects Plngawan, Klesan, S'uli, and Matu'aw can be subgrouped together into the Southern Atayal subgroup based primarily on lexical evidence. All four also share the merger of Proto-Atayal \*q and \*ʔ and the devoicing of final \*b. We cannot say with certainty that these two sound changes occurred before the subgroup split further, but assume that is the case due to the absence of any evidence to the contrary. All four dialects also have undergone the loss of final \*g, however in this case we know that some Matu'aw speakers still preserved it at least into the 1980s [@li1981], and this is not a shared innovation, but instead a sound change that occurred multiple times independently.

Sound changes in consonants from Proto-Atayal to Proto-Southern Atayal (PSA) are demonstrated in @tbl:pa-to-psa-consonants. The loss of Proto-Atayal \*q is the most salient change, although the loss of Proto-Atayal \*ʔ in the environment a\_í and a\_ú must have also occurred at this stage.

Plngawan underwent further changes in its consonants, most prominently rhotacism, which occurred in an identical environment to that of Squliq. Proto-Atayal word-final labials became velars in Plngawan, Proto-Atayal word-final \*g was lenited, and Proto-Atayal \*x in \*xuɹil 'dog' was changed into /h/ in Plngawan *huɹil*.

Proto-Southern Atayal made some changes to Proto-Atayal syllabification, as seen in @tbl:pa-to-psa-vowels. Previous disyllabic sequences CV.GVC were changed into monosyllabic CGVC if the penultimate vowel and the glide were homorganic, e.g. Proto-Atayal \*buwax 'unhusked rice' > Proto-Southern Atayal \*bwax. Monophthongization of offglides in penultimate syllables had not yet occurred. We know this because of Plngawan and Matu'aw reflexes, which preserve prepenultimate vowel distinctions; Matu'aw additionally lacks monophthongization.

Plngawan later monophthongized vowel sequences agressively, resulting in a larger number of coalesced vowels than any Atayal dialect. Not only did Plngawan change non-final offglides into mid vowels like many other dialects, but it monophthongized onglides as well: Proto-Atayal \*buwax 'unhusked rice' > PSA \*bwax > Plngawan *box*; Proto-Atayal \*qusiyaʔ 'water' > PSA \*ʔusyaʔ > Plngawan *ʔuseʔ*.

Plngawan shares lexical innovations with both Southwestern Atayal and Klesan, though few are shared among all three. This is likely due to later innovations and lexical replacement due to language contact in each of these three branches. The relevant data is listed in @tbl:psa-innovations.

Lexical innovations shared between Plngawan, Klesan, and Southwestern Atayal include Plngawan *ramuʔuy*, S'uli *r**in**muʔi*, Klesan *rəmuʔi* 'roof', a derived male register form (< Proto-Southern Atayal \*r**in**Vmuʔi[g]),^[Final \*g in this Proto-Southern Atayal form is uncertain, as indicated by square brackets, but possible based on reflexes of Proto-Atayal final \*g in other words.] cf. Squliq *r**ən**amuw*; and Plngawan, Matu'aw, and Klesan *luʔiŋ* 'marrow', also a novel male register form (< Proto-Southern Atayal \*luʔiŋ), cf. Squliq *luqiʔ*, Matu'uwal *luqus*. Plngawan shares some innovations only with Klesan or Southwestern Atayal, but not both: Plngawan *ɹapak*, Matu'aw *yapayap* 'flower' (< Proto-Southern Atayal \*ɹapəɹap); Plngawan *ʔuɹamiy*, S'uli *yamay*, Matu'aw *ʔuyamay* 'stone' (< Proto-Southern Atayal \*ʔuɹamay); Plngawan *gagɹaʔ*, Klesan *gəya* 'seed' (< Proto-Southern Atayal \*gagəɹaʔ). This patchwork of lexical innovations can be explained by Klesan and Southwestern Atayal replacing some shared innovations with loans or newer coinages (although my data for S'uli and Matu'aw is incomplete, and more cognates may be found in the future).

Klesan and Plngawan share very few lexical items, and one sound change: the merger of final labials into velars. The sound change is rather common, and due to the low amount of uniquely shared vocabulary, these lexical items are likely common retentions rather than innovations. The evidence for subgrouping Klesan together with S'uli and Matu'aw is stronger, which means the word-final labial-velar merger occurred independently in Klesan and Plngawan.

### Evidence for a Nuclear Southern Atayal subgroup {#sec:nuclear-southern-atayal-evidence}

The evidence for classifying Klesan, S'uli, and Matu'aw together into the Nuclear Southern Atayal subgroup includes additional shared lexical innovations and the merger of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ and \*y (this sound change also occurred independently in Nuclear Northern Atayal). Consonant correspondences between Proto-Atayal, Proto-Southern Atayal, and Proto-Nuclear Southern Atayal (PNSA) are demonstrated in @tbl:pa-to-pnsa-consonants. The aforementioned merger between Proto-Atayal \*ɹ and \*y was the only consonantal change from PSA to PNSA.

Klesan later lost final glottal stops, merged final labials with velars, and underwent liquid assimilation.

Vowels remained completely unchanged between PSA and PNSA, as seen in @tbl:pa-to-pnsa-vowels. We know this thanks to Matu'aw evidence, since Klesan and S'uli both underwent prepenultimate vowel weakening and monophthongization.

Klesan later weakened prepenultimate vowels and monophthongized offglides in penultimate position, e.g. PNSA \*ʔusyaʔ 'water' > Klesan *ʔəsya*, PNSA \*bayhuy 'wind' > Klesan *behuy*. Its monophthongization affected offglides preceding final glottal stops, unlike in S'uli: Proto-Atayal \*suwaʔiʔ 'younger sibling' > PNSA \*suwayʔ > Klesan *səswe*, cf. S'uli *sway*.

S'uli and Matu'aw share more lexical innovations with Klesan than they do with Plngawan (@sec:shared-innovations-su-kl). These may be either completely new lexical items or novel male register forms. The full list of lexical innovations can be seen in @tbl:pnsa-innovations.

New lexical items include S'uli *byux* and Klesan *bəyux* 'buttocks' (< Proto-Nuclear Southern Atayal \*bəyux), or S'uli and Klesan *həra* 'leftovers' (< Proto-Nuclear Southern Atayal \*həra[ʔ]). Some examples of novel male register forms are S'uli, Klesan *myux* and Matu'aw *mamyux* 'husked rice' (< Proto-Nuclear Southern Atayal \*mamyux, cf. Proto-Atayal \*mamiʔ); S'uli *həmaʔuy*, Klesan *maʔuy*, Matu'aw *hamaʔuy* 'tongue' (< Proto-Nuclear Southern Atayal \*həmaʔuy, cf. Proto-Atayal \*həmaʔ < PAn \*Səma). They also share semantic changes like S'uli, Klesan *sali*, Matu'aw *saliʔ* 'house', from Proto-Atayal \*saliq which referred to a structure in a field used primarily during sowing and harvest work (cf. Skikun *saliq* 'house in field'). There are shared aberrations between the dialects as well, such as the irregular final /t/ in S'uli *pəsəhut* and Klesan *pəcəhut* 'to suck (AV)', cf. Matu'uwal *pəsihub*, Squliq *cəhop*.

Lexical innovations in Nuclear Southern Atayal are readily detectable despite evidence of heavy Squliq influence on Klesan (@sec:borrowings-cu). Klesan has loanwords of Squliq origin in many parts of its vocabulary, including basic words: Klesan *cipok* and Squliq *cipoq* (this word appears to be a Squliq innovation, but cf. Skikun *cipiq*/*cipaq*), Klesan *byaciŋ* and Squliq *bəzyaciŋ* 'moon' (cf. Proto-Atayal \*buɹatiŋ), Klesan *cira* and Squliq *ciraʔ* 'spindle' (cf. Proto-Atayal \*matisaʔ), Klesan *kenu* and Squliq *təqinu* 'mushrooms' (cf. Proto-Atayal \*tVqaqinug), Klesan *k**əm**asu* and Squliq *q**əm**asuw* 'to divide, to share' (cf. Proto-Atayal \*q**um**asug). These loans can be identified through irregular correspondences like Squliq /q/ to Klesan /k/ instead of regular /ʔ/, or Squliq /ci/ to Klesan /ci/ instead of regular /ti/. With the presence of Squliq loanwords in Klesan with identifiable irregularities, it is equally likely that there are also borrowings from Squliq without such diagnostic sounds, however we do not have any direct means of proving that they are loans.

S'uli and Klesan both have liquid assimilation, prepenultimate vowel lenition, and the loss of final \*g. However Matu'aw, which together with S'uli forms the Southwestern Atayal subgroup, does not share these sound changes with S'uli (Matu'aw did lose its word-final \*g, but it is a very recent change). These three sound changes must therefore have occurred independently in S'uli and Klesan. S'uli and Klesan also share the tendency to merge final /l/ into /n/, however this change is common to young speakers across all Atayal dialects, and is simply more pronounced in these two varieties. Note that the aforementioned sound changes also occurred independently in Squliq (and Skikun, with the exception of the loss of \*-g), and thus indicate either linguistic drift or commonalities due to language contact.

#### Evidence for a Southwestern Atayal subgroup {#sec:southwestern-atayal-evidence}

In addition to all the innovations of Southern Atayal and Nuclear Southern Atayal, S'uli and Matu'aw share even more lexical innovations and aberrations with each other, and also the merger of Proto-Atayal \*c and \*s. @tbl:pa-to-pswa-consonants provides an outlook of changes from Proto-Atayal to Proto-Southwestern Atayal (PSWA) and later to S'uli and Matu'aw for all consonants.

The merger of Proto-Atayal \*c and \*s is the only consonantal change from PNSA to PSWA. Even though both S'uli and Matu'aw have lost Proto-Atayal \*g in word-final position, it was attested by Li in 1980 [@li1980;@li1981;@li1982b], and was thus an independent change. S'uli additionally lost word-final glottal stops, and merged Proto-Atayal word-final \*l into /n/.

No vowel changes occurred from PNSA to PSWA, as seen in @tbl:pa-to-pswa-vowels. After the split of PSWA, S'uli underwent prepenultimate weakening and monophthongization of offlides in the penultimate syllable, and Matu'aw merged Proto-Atayal \*ə into /a/.

They also share several sporadic changes, for instance the penultimate vowel in S'uli ***mə**siwat* and Matu'aw ***ma**siwat* 'to stop raining', compare Proto-Atayal \***ma**suwat.

## Interim summary {#sec:subgrouping-summary}

The evidence in this chapter supports the following generalizations about the historical development of Atayal:

1. There is a clear division into two groups, here named Northern and Southern Atayal, supported by both lexical and phonological evidence.
2. There is a significant amount of drift in Atayal dialects, with identical sound changes occurring multiple times in different dialects. This makes subgrouping impossible based on phonological evidence alone.
3. Language contact between Atayal communities persisted after the break-up of Proto-Atayal into individual dialects, as evidenced by numerous loanwords in various dialects. Klesan and S'uli both have a stratum of Squliq loans. Plngawan and Matu'uwal largely escaped this interdialectal language contact due to their position on the periphery of the Atayal-speaking territory.

My subgrouping proposal is supported by both phonological and lexical evidence at each node of the subgrouping tree. This is in stark contrast to the original *Squliq-C'uli'* division [@utsurikawa1935], which included only two groups, placing Squliq apart from all the other dialects, and not clarifying the subgrouping inside *C'uli'*. Without any subgrouping of lower nodes, it did not make clear which dialects were included in the *C'uli'* group, or even how many dialects were being subgrouped. My subgrouping proposal uses binary branching on all nodes of the tree, making it much more detailed. In terms of the subgrouping itself, the main difference is the placement of Skikun and Matu'uwal together with Squliq in the same subgroup (Northern Atayal).

# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

## Summary

This dissertation presents the first and so far the only Atayal subgrouping proposal based on linguistic criteria. A possible reason for the lack of previous subgrouping proposals is the complexity of sound changes in Atayal, some of which occurred independently several times throughout the group. In this dissertation, I complemented the deficiency in phonological evidence with lexical evidence. Since data for most Atayal dialects is not readily available, this required me to do my own fieldwork and collect enough lexical material to support a subgrouping proposal.

The main goal of this dissertation was to disprove the *Squliq* and *C'uli'* dichotomy of Atayal dialects and present an alternative subgrouping. There is ample evidence from both sound changes and lexical innovations for subgrouping Squliq together with Skikun and Matu'uwal in what I have termed *Northern Atayal*. The three dialects of Northern Atayal all share a crucial and extremely specific merger of Proto-Atayal word-final \*-lit and \*-liʔ. The remaining dialects can also be subgrouped together as *Southern Atayal*, though primarily using lexical evidence, since the sound changes in the Southern group are all quite common, and in fact many happened independently several times. Matu'aw evidence was important in determining the relative order of sound changes as well as the fact that changes like liquid assimilation and prepenultimate vowel lenition occurred independently in S'uli and Klesan.

The lexical evidence was not a straightforward path to a coherent subgrouping, and the main hurdle was the massive influence Squliq has had on some Atayal dialects, most notably Klesan and S'uli. To utilize lexical evidence properly, I first had to find cases of lexical borrowing between the Atayal dialects, which in turn required me to correctly identify the regular sound correspondences between Atayal dialects, as well as the sound changes from Proto-Atayal to each individual dialect. On the other hand, the overwhelming presence of Squliq lended more weight to evidence of genetic links between other dialects, both phonological and lexical. Since small Atayal dialects are spoken mostly far away from each other, the possibility of language contact is almost nonexistent, and any shared features are much more likely to be inherited from a common ancestor rather than borrowed.

In this dissertation, I discussed several distinct but related topics: the synchronic phonology of Atayal dialects, the phonological system of Proto-Atayal, and the subgrouping and diachronic development of Atayal dialects.

Chapter 3 is a detailed description of the phonological systems of seven Atayal dialects. It presented their consonantal and vocalic inventories, syllable structures, and phonotactics. The chapter also included an overview of the most common affixation-induced consonantal and vocalic alternations across Atayal dialects. These synchronic descriptions laid the groundwork for the reconstruction of the phonology of Proto-Atayal, the ancestor of all the Atayal dialects.

Chapter 4 is a step-by-step reconstruction of the phonology of Proto-Atayal. I began with establishing regular correspondences for each individual segment in Proto-Atayal, as well as combinations of segments where necessary (this is needed with vowels, which undergo coalescence in many Atayal dialects). I also examined the phonotactics of the protolanguage in a separate section. Apart from direct internal evidence from Atayal dialects, I also made use of external evidence from Seediq and Proto-Austronesian, which was explained individually for both of these sources. I then presented a list of sound changes from Proto-Atayal to each individual dialect. Sound changes between Li's [-@li1981] Proto-Atayalic and my Proto-Atayal were listed as well: there were only two systematic sound changes, but I tackled the bigger issue of two incompatible protophonemes reconstructed by Li, and concluded that in both cases they should not be reconstructed to Proto-Atayalic. The chapter also included a list of sound correspondences between Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Atayal.

Chapter 5 took an in-depth look at the lexical evidence for Atayal subgrouping. After a brief introduction to the voice morphology of Atayal and its reconstruction to Proto-Atayal, I delved into the gender register system in Atayal. The gender register system is a mechanism of lexical derivation and obfuscation that can be found in a large amount of words in Atayal. Derivations related to the gender register system began before the split of Proto-Atayalic, as evidenced by the presence of semantically vacuous derivational affixes (e.g. Proto-Atayalic \*qabulit 'ash' < PAn \*qabu). After the split of Proto-Atayalic, the system was developed further in Atayal, and was still productive after the split of Proto-Atayal. Even though the gender register system often obscures cognacy with other Austronesian languages, I showed that we can use it to our advantage when subgrouping Atayal dialects. Next I discussed lexical innovations and shared aberrations between Atayal dialects, where a clear divide into two groups---North and South---could already be established. This was despite heavy influence of the prestige Squliq dialect on its many neighbours. Luckily, borrowings from Squliq could in many cases be identified, and I addressed the problem of interdialectal loans later in the chapter. Lastly, I presented additional external evidence from Seediq and Proto-Austronesian, to help us distinguish shared retentions from shared innovations.

Chapter 6 contains the final subgrouping proposal along with a discussion of supporting evidence. I provided both phonological and lexical evidence for subgrouping at the level of each separate node of the phylogenetic tree. Sound changes alone could not be used to subgroup Atayal dialects, due to an erratic distribution of identical changes induced by drift. No matter how we tried to group Atayal dialects together, some sound changes would still have to occur independently multiple times. This in itself is not surprising, since most of the sound changes in Atayal dialects are quite common cross-linguistically. The most bizarre sound change (the merger of Proto-Atayal word-final \*-liʔ and \*-lit) coincided with the Northern group determined by lexical innovations. The Southern group did not have the same strong phonological evidence, but the evidence grew incrementally once we went deeper into the group, with Nuclear Southern Atayal sharing an important merger of Proto-Atayal \*ɹ and \*y. The affinity of Plngawan with Southern Atayal was determined through lexical innovations, since the only sound changes it shared with the rest of the group were vowel coalescence and the change of Proto-Atayal \*q > ʔ, which in theory could have been independent developments. The addition of lexical innovations specific to the Southern group cemented the place of Plngawan in its ranks.

Ironically, my new subgrouping harkens back to Ogawa's original claim of the presence or absence of the /q/ phoneme as being the most salient indicator of dialectal affinity in Atayal [@ogawa1935, p. 21]. The Southern group has in fact lost Proto-Atayal \*q, while the Northern group has preserved it,^[Some varieties of Squliq lost Proto-Atayal \*q independently, for example the speech in the tribal villages Kulu and Haga-Paris in I-lan County, as recorded by @li1998.] although this sound change was **not** the deciding piece of evidence in my subgrouping, and is just a coincidence.

## Contribution

This dissertation contributes to our understanding of Atayal in various ways. From the point of view of language documentation, the appendix alone is probably the largest cross-dialectal comparative vocabulary of Atayal ever published. The appendix is an abridged version, containing only those etyma that could be reconstructed to Proto-Atayal. The wordlist I compiled is about 2500 items long (though not all items have been collected for every dialect), and will be archived in a transparent way in the future. In the spirit of openness and cooperation, I plan to share this data with the Atayal-speaking community as well as with the linguistic community. 

I provided a detailed description of the synchronic phonologies of seven different Atayal dialects, put together in one place. The descriptions of vowel alternations in Plngawan, as well as the interactions of vowel-alternating processes in Matu'uwal, have not previously been discussed in linguistic literature. This dissertation also sheds light on Matu'aw, an Atayal dialect first 'discovered' by Li [-@li1980;-@li1981;-@li1982b], but afterwards largely forgotten. Matu'aw has never received a phonological description before this time. The issue of rhythmic vowel weakening in various Atayal dialects has received very little attention from scholars, only being discussed by @huang2017a for Matu'uwal.

From the perspective of diachronic linguistics, my contributions include the reconstruction of the phonology of Proto-Atayal in detail, in such a way that makes it easy to compare with its ancestors Proto-Atayalic and Proto-Austronesian. I also reconstructed a large amount of Proto-Atayal vocabulary (circa 1100 items) based on the data I collected; these reconstructions are included in the appendix.

The final contribution of this dissertation is the first linguistically sound subgrouping of Atayal dialects. This subgrouping is extremely detailed, and backed up by linguistic evidence from both phonological and lexical changes at each node of the phylogenetic tree. It greatly improves our understanding of the nature of the genetic relationship between the various Atayal dialects.

## Directions for future research

Although the question of Atayal subgrouping has been answered, I have uncovered new unsolved problems along the way that provide excellent avenues of further research.

Even though I contributed a description of the phonologies of seven Atayal dialects, many of them still remain underresearched. S'uli, Matu'aw, Skikun, Klesan, and Plngawan have all had a very low amount of descriptive work done on them in every aspect of linguistics, and one could start almost anywhere with most of these.

On the synchronic phonological side, the interactions between different vowel alternation processes in Matu'uwal, namely hiatus resolution and rhythmic vowel reduction (see @sec:matuuwal-hiatus-resolution), are quite complex. An in-depth look is needed to unravel that mystery.

During the writing of this dissertation, I noticed several synchronic phonological processes that I could not yet describe or analyze to my satisfaction, and thus I had to omit them until a later time. Some Plngawan roots have alternations of the consonant /ɹ/ with ∅, but I have not yet found a pattern. Matu'aw seems to have vowel weakening processes, whereby high vowels get lenited into /a/, but I do not have sufficient data to provide an analysis.

Some correspondences of third-to-last vowels between Matu'uwal, Matu'aw, and Plngawan are yet to be resolved. In certain cases I lacked data, but in others it was a problem of contradictory evidence, which led to uncertainty in some of my Proto-Atayal reconstructions.

The findings of this dissertation can be further used to make adjustments to Li's [-@li1981] Proto-Atayalic reconstruction, as I have already done for the phonemes \*g' and word-final \*-d (see @sec:proto-atayalic-to-proto-atayal). Since the Atayalic branch is considered one of the earlier offshoots of the Austronesian family tree [@blust1999a, p. 46], its reconstruction has a disproportionately large influence on the reconstruction of Proto-Austronesian. There is also the conundrum of several Proto-Austronesian phonemes having multiple reflexes in Proto-Atayal (and Proto-Atayalic) without any apparent conditioning factors. For example, Proto-Austronesian word-initial \*S is reflected as Proto-Atayal \*s in some cases, but as \*h in others, in identical environments. Several other Proto-Austronesian phonemes also have multiple reflexes, most notably PAn \*j, which has a null reflex in some words but surfaces as Proto-Atayal \*g in others (sound correspondences between PAn and Proto-Atayal are presented in @sec:pan-to-proto-atayal). Future research in Austronesian historical linguistics will have to account for these irregularities.

Even though this dissertation presents a reconstruction of the phonology of Proto-Atayal and a sizeable vocabulary, some aspects of the protolanguage are yet to be reconstructed. These include its pronominal system, nominal case markers, and derivational morphology. Future work on Proto-Atayal could concentrate on these aspects.
